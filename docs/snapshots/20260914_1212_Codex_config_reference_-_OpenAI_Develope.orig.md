Configuration Reference

Complete reference for Codex config.toml and requirements.toml

Use this page as a searchable reference for Codex configuration files. For conceptual guidance and examples, start with Config basics and Advanced Config.

config.toml

User-level configuration lives in ~/.codex/config.toml. You can also add project-scoped overrides in .codex/config.toml files. Codex loads project-scoped config files only when you trust the project.

Project-scoped config can't override machine-local provider, auth, host-owned app request metadata, notification, configuration profile selection, or telemetry routing keys. Codex ignores openai_base_url, chatgpt_base_url, apps_mcp_product_sku, model_provider, model_providers, notify, profile, profiles, experimental_realtime_ws_base_url, and otel when they appear in a project-local .codex/config.toml; put provider, notification, and telemetry keys in user-level config instead. Config profile files live next to config.toml as $CODEX_HOME/profile-name.config.toml; select one with --profile profile-name.

For sandbox and approval keys (approval_policy, sandbox_mode, and sandbox_workspace_write.*), pair this reference with Sandbox and approvals, Protected paths in writable roots, and Network access. For beta permission profiles, see Permissions.

Codex and ChatGPT Work no longer support approval_policy = "untrusted". Remove the setting or choose a supported policy. Project entries with trust_level = "untrusted" in user-level ~/.codex/config.toml remain supported. See Migrate from the retired untrusted approval policy for examples and approval tradeoffs.

mcp_oauth_callback_url	string	
Optional base callback URL for MCP OAuth login, such as a devbox ingress URL. Newly added pre-registered clients use this URL unchanged when the authorization server supports issuer identification; existing clients without a saved callback append a server-specific callback ID. Without issuer support, any pre-registered MCP server whose configured callback lacks the required ID falls back to this URL with the ID appended. Callback URL ports don't select the listener port.

mcp_oauth_credentials_store	auto | file | keyring	
Preferred store for MCP OAuth credentials.

mcp_optional_startup_grace_ms	integer (milliseconds)	
Shared wait for optional MCP servers when building the initial tool catalog. Defaults to 1000. Set to 0 to wait for each server's startup_timeout_sec instead.

mcp_servers.<id>.args	array<string>	
Arguments passed to the MCP stdio server command.

mcp_servers.<id>.auth	oauth | chatgpt	
Authentication fallback for an MCP HTTP server after configured bearer tokens and authorization headers. oauth (default) uses stored MCP OAuth credentials when available. chatgpt uses the current ChatGPT session for the trusted first-party ChatGPT origin, then falls back to stored OAuth. Both modes can connect without authentication if no credential source resolves.

Environment variables forwarded to the MCP stdio server.

mcp_servers.<id>.env_http_headers	map<string,string>	
HTTP headers populated from environment variables for an MCP HTTP server.

mcp_servers.<id>.env_vars	array<string | { name = string, source = "local" | "remote" }>	
Additional environment variables to whitelist for an MCP stdio server. String entries default to source = "local"; use source = "remote" only with executor-backed remote stdio.

mcp_servers.<id>.experimental_environment	local | remote	
Experimental placement for an MCP server. remote starts stdio servers through a remote executor environment; streamable HTTP remote placement is not implemented.

Static HTTP headers included with each MCP HTTP request.

mcp_servers.<id>.http_headers_helper	string (command)	
Local command that prints a JSON object of HTTP header names and values. Supported only for locally connected HTTP MCP servers. Explicit bearer tokens and OAuth credentials take precedence over helper-provided Authorization headers.

mcp_servers.<id>.oauth_resource	string	
Optional RFC 8707 OAuth resource parameter to include during MCP login.

mcp_servers.<id>.oauth.callback_port	integer	
Fixed OAuth callback listener port for this MCP server. Overrides mcp_oauth_callback_port. For a direct loopback callback with an explicit URL port, configure the same listener port.

mcp_servers.<id>.oauth.callback_url	string	
Server-specific OAuth callback. Pre-registered clients reuse it when issuer identification is supported or the URL already ends in the server-specific callback ID. Otherwise, Codex uses the global or default callback with that ID appended. Clients without a pre-registered ID use this callback during client registration.

mcp_servers.<id>.oauth.client_id	string	
Pre-registered OAuth client ID used for authorization and token exchange with this MCP server.

mcp_servers.<id>.required	boolean	
When true, fail startup/resume if this enabled MCP server cannot initialize.

Plan-mode-specific reasoning override. When unset, Plan mode uses its built-in preset default.

plugins.<plugin>.enabled	boolean	
Enable or disable a local-marketplace plugin using a plugin-name@marketplace-name key. Read from the effective merged config; trusted-project settings can override user, cloud-managed, and system defaults. Marketplace refresh can install or refresh configured plugins even when disabled. This does not override workspace-managed enabled states.

sandbox_workspace_write.network_access	boolean	
Allow outbound network access inside the workspace-write sandbox.

sandbox_workspace_write.writable_roots	array<string>	
Additional writable roots when sandbox_mode = "workspace-write".

service_tier	string	
Preferred service tier for new turns. Use fast or another tier advertised by the active model; fast maps to the request value priority.

shell_environment_policy.exclude	array<string>	
Legacy environment-variable exclusion patterns. Use shell_environment_policy.filters for new configuration; don't combine both forms in the same layer.

shell_environment_policy.experimental_use_profile	boolean	
Use the user shell profile when spawning subprocesses.

shell_environment_policy.filters	map<string, include | exclude>	
Canonical case-insensitive environment-variable pattern filters. Include entries create an allowlist and can't restore excluded values. Explicit set values apply after exclusions. Don't combine filters with legacy exclude or include_only arrays in the same layer.

sqlite_home	string (path)	
Directory where Codex stores the SQLite-backed state DB used by agent jobs and other resumable runtime state.

suppress_unstable_features_warning	boolean	
Suppress the warning that appears when under-development feature flags are enabled.

tool_output_token_limit	number	
Token budget for storing individual tool/function outputs in history.

tool_suggest.disabled_tools	array<table>	
Disable suggestions for specific discoverable connectors or plugins. Each entry uses type = "connector" or "plugin" and an id.

tool_suggest.discoverables	array<table>	
Allow tool suggestions for additional discoverable connectors or plugins. Each entry uses type = "connector" or "plugin" and an id.

tools.view_image	boolean	
Enable the local-image attachment tool view_image.

tools.web_search	boolean | { context_size = "low|medium|high", allowed_domains = [string], location = { country, region, city, timezone } }	
Optional web search tool configuration. The object form can set search context size, allowed search domains, and approximate user location. These search-domain filters are separate from sandboxed-command network domain rules and do not restrict connectors or MCP servers.

tui	table	
TUI-specific options such as enabling inline desktop notifications.

tui.alternate_screen	auto | always | never	
Control alternate screen usage for the TUI (default: auto; auto skips it in Zellij to preserve scrollback).

tui.animations	boolean	
Enable terminal animations (welcome screen, shimmer, spinner) (default: true).

tui.keymap.<context>.<action>	string | array<string>	
Keyboard shortcut binding for a TUI action. Supported contexts include global, chat, composer, editor, vim_normal, vim_operator, vim_text_object, pager, list, and approval. Selected composer actions fall back to matching tui.keymap.global bindings; context-specific bindings take precedence when supported.

tui.keymap.<context>.<action> = []	empty array	
Unbind the action in that keymap context. Key names use normalized strings such as ctrl-a, shift-enter, page-down, or minus.

tui.model_availability_nux.<model>	integer	
Internal startup-tooltip state keyed by model slug.

tui.notification_condition	unfocused | always	
Control whether TUI notifications fire only when the terminal is unfocused or regardless of focus. Defaults to unfocused.

Notification method for terminal notifications (default: auto).

tui.notifications	boolean | array<string>	
Enable TUI notifications; optionally restrict to specific event types.

tui.raw_output_mode	boolean	
Start the TUI in raw scrollback mode for copy-friendly terminal selection (default: false). You can toggle it with /raw or the default alt-r key binding.

tui.resume_cwd	current | session	
Working directory to use when resuming or forking a session. When unset, Codex asks you to choose if your current directory differs from the session's saved directory.

tui.show_tooltips	boolean	
Show onboarding tooltips in the TUI welcome screen (default: true).

tui.status_line	array<string> | null	
Ordered list of TUI footer status-line item identifiers. null disables the status line.

Ordered list of terminal window/tab title item identifiers. Defaults to ["spinner", "project"]; null disables title updates.

tui.theme	string	
Syntax-highlighting theme override (kebab-case theme name).

tui.vim_mode_default	boolean	
Start the composer in Vim normal mode instead of insert mode (default: false). You can still toggle it per session with /vim.

web_search	disabled | cached | indexed | live	
Web search mode (default: "cached"; cached uses an OpenAI-maintained index without external web access; indexed permits external access only when gated by the search index; if you use --yolo or another full access sandbox setting, it defaults to "live"). Use "live" for unrestricted live retrieval, or "disabled" to remove the tool.

windows_wsl_setup_acknowledged	boolean	
Track Windows onboarding acknowledgement (Windows only).

windows.sandbox	unelevated | elevated	
Windows-only native sandbox mode when running Codex natively on Windows.

windows.sandbox_private_desktop	boolean

You can find the latest JSON schema for config.toml here.

To get autocompletion and diagnostics when editing config.toml in VS Code or Cursor, you can install the Even Better TOML extension and add this line to the top of your config.toml:

#:schema https://developers.openai.com/codex/config-schema.json

Note: Rename experimental_instructions_file to model_instructions_file. Codex deprecates the old key; update existing configs to the new name.

requirements.toml

requirements.toml is an admin-enforced configuration file that constrains security-sensitive settings users can't override. For details, locations, and examples, see Admin-enforced requirements.

For ChatGPT Business and Enterprise users, Codex can also apply cloud-fetched requirements. See the security page for precedence details.

Use [features] in requirements.toml to pin runtime feature flags by the same canonical keys that config.toml uses. Requirements can also include documented app-only keys that don't belong in config.toml. Omitted keys remain unconstrained.

Some managed requirements enforce an exact configuration value instead of an allowlist. Users can't override an enforced path, update preference, login-shell policy, feedback setting, or Windows private-desktop setting.

Managed permission-profile allowlists require Codex 0.138.0 or later. Codex 0.137.0 and earlier ignore allowed_permission_profiles and managed default_permissions.

Use allowed_sandbox_modes with sandbox_mode. For permission-profile deployments, use allowed_permission_profiles with managed default_permissions.

An untrusted entry in allowed_approval_policies is still valid for the stricter approval behavior Codex derives when a project uses trust_level = "untrusted". It does not permit explicitly setting approval_policy = "untrusted".

The [models.new_thread] table supplies managed defaults, not enforcement. If you explicitly override the model or reasoning effort with --model, --config, or --profile, Codex ignores both model and model_reasoning_effort in [models.new_thread]. service_tier is independent.

The browser requirements cover three separate surfaces. in_app_browser controls the browser pane that a person opens and uses directly. browser_use controls agent-driven work in a browser. computer_use controls agent-driven work in native desktop apps.

The nested Browser Use and Computer Use policy values do not grant access by themselves. An origin- or app-specific allow can override the fallback for the same policy source, but normal feature, approval, and other policy checks still apply. Where managed requirements and config.toml both apply, a deny from either one wins.

Key	Type / Values	Details
allow_appshots	boolean	
Set to false to disable Appshots for managed users. If omitted, Appshots remain unconstrained by requirements and follow normal product availability.

allow_browser_and_computer_use	boolean	
Set to false to block both agent-driven Browser Use and native-app Computer Use. Setting it to true or omitting it does not enable either feature; the remaining feature, policy, and approval checks still apply.

allow_login_shell	boolean	
Enforce whether shell tools can start a login shell.

allow_managed_hooks_only	boolean	
When true, Codex skips user, project, session, and plugin hooks while still allowing managed hooks from requirements.toml and other managed config layers.

allow_remote_control	boolean	
Set to false to disable device remote control for managed users. If omitted, device remote control remains unconstrained by requirements and follows normal product availability.

allowed_approval_policies	array<string>	
Allowed approval policies, such as on-request, never, and granular. Include untrusted to permit the stricter policy derived from an untrusted project; it cannot be selected directly with approval_policy.

allowed_approvals_reviewers	array<string>	
Allowed values for approvals_reviewer, such as user and auto_review.

allowed_chatgpt_workspaces	array<string>	
Restrict ChatGPT login, including Codex access tokens, to the listed workspace IDs. An empty list disables ChatGPT login; API authentication remains available when permitted. Set through the local system requirements file or macOS MDM; cloud-managed values are ignored.

allowed_login_methods	array<string>	
Allow chatgpt, api, or both. If omitted, this setting doesn't restrict login methods. If set, the list must contain at least one method. api permits API authentication, including Amazon Bedrock. Set through the local system requirements file or macOS MDM. Cloud-managed values are ignored.

allowed_permission_profiles	table<boolean>	
Complete list of allowed permission profiles. Profiles set to true are allowed. Profiles that are omitted or set to false are denied, including profiles added in future versions. When requirements sources are combined, entries are matched by profile name.

allowed_permission_profiles.<name>	boolean	
Allow or deny a built-in or custom permission profile defined in a loaded config or requirements source. A later, higher-precedence requirements source can use false to turn off a profile allowed by an earlier, lower-precedence source.

allowed_sandbox_modes	array<string>	
Allowed values for sandbox_mode.

allowed_web_search_modes	array<string>	
Allowed values for web_search (disabled, cached, indexed, live). disabled is always allowed; an empty list effectively allows only disabled.

apps	table	
Managed app requirements keyed by app identifier. Requirements can disable an app or constrain approval behavior for individual tools.

apps.<id>.enabled	boolean	
Set to false to disable an app. A disabled requirement remains restrictive when multiple requirements sources are merged.

apps.<id>.tools.<tool>.approval_mode	auto | prompt | writes | approve	
Set the managed approval mode for one app tool.

browser_use	table	
Managed requirements for agent-driven Browser Use.

browser_use.allow_global_persistent_approval	boolean	
Set to false to prevent Browser Use from creating or honoring Always allow approvals that cover every site, such as allowing downloads from any site. Existing saved approvals are ignored, not deleted. Setting it to true or omitting it does not create an approval.

browser_use.allow_history_access	boolean	
Set to false to prevent Browser Use from reading browser history. Setting it to true or omitting it leaves normal history settings and availability checks in place.

browser_use.default_origin_policy	table	
Fallback for each Browser Use setting when no matching entry under browser_use.origins defines it. A matching origin rule replaces the fallback for that source. Codex then applies the stricter result from managed requirements and user configuration.

browser_use.default_origin_policy.access	allow | deny	
Use deny to block Browser Use on origins that use the fallback. A denied origin also blocks uploads, downloads, full browser debugging access, and automatic review there. allow only lets normal approval and policy checks continue.

browser_use.default_origin_policy.access_approval_lifetime	turn | thread	
Set how long a non-persistent site-access approval lasts: turn limits it to the current turn, and thread keeps it for the rest of the current thread. persistent_approval separately controls whether Always allow is available. The product default is thread.

browser_use.default_origin_policy.auto_review	allow | deny	
Use deny to skip automatic review on origins that use the fallback and ask the user for approval instead. allow leaves automatic review available when other settings allow it.

browser_use.default_origin_policy.downloads	allow | deny	
Use deny to block Browser Use downloads on origins that use the fallback. allow only lets normal approval and policy checks continue.

browser_use.default_origin_policy.full_cdp_access	allow | deny	
Use deny to block full Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) access on origins that use the fallback. allow only lets normal opt-in and approval checks continue.

browser_use.default_origin_policy.persistent_approval	boolean	
Set to false to prevent Browser Use from saving or honoring an Always allow approval on origins that use the fallback. Approvals for the current turn or thread can still apply. true makes Always allow available when otherwise permitted but does not create an approval.

browser_use.default_origin_policy.uploads	allow | deny	
Use deny to block Browser Use uploads on origins that use the fallback. allow only lets normal approval and policy checks continue.

browser_use.disable_auto_review	boolean	
Set to true to skip automatic review for Browser Use and ask the user for approval instead. Setting it to false or omitting it leaves automatic review available when other settings allow it.

browser_use.origins	map<string, table>	
Origin-specific Browser Use policies. Keys use <scheme>://<host-pattern>[:<port>] with http or https. Use an exact host, *.example.com for subdomains only, or **.example.com for the base domain and its subdomains. Other * wildcards can span dots, so region*.example.com also matches region.api.example.com; a host of * matches every host for that scheme. Schemes and nondefault ports are significant; explicit default ports are normalized away. Paths, queries, embedded usernames or passwords, and wildcard schemes or ports are invalid. Quote the pattern in TOML, for example [browser_use.origins."https://**.example.com"].

browser_use.origins.<pattern>	table	
Policy for origins matching this pattern. If several patterns match, Codex uses the most restrictive value for each capability: deny over allow, false over true, and turn over thread.

browser_use.origins.<pattern>.access	allow | deny	
Use deny to block Browser Use on matching origins. Denial also blocks uploads, downloads, full browser debugging access, and automatic review there. allow only lets normal approval and policy checks continue.

browser_use.origins.<pattern>.access_approval_lifetime	turn | thread	
Set how long a non-persistent site-access approval for matching origins lasts: turn limits it to the current turn, and thread keeps it for the rest of the current thread. persistent_approval separately controls whether Always allow is available.

browser_use.origins.<pattern>.auto_review	allow | deny	
Use deny to skip automatic review on matching origins and ask the user for approval instead. allow leaves automatic review available when other settings allow it.

browser_use.origins.<pattern>.downloads	allow | deny	
Use deny to block Browser Use downloads on matching origins. allow only lets normal approval and policy checks continue.

browser_use.origins.<pattern>.full_cdp_access	allow | deny	
Use deny to block full Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) access on matching origins. allow only lets normal opt-in and approval checks continue.

browser_use.origins.<pattern>.persistent_approval	boolean	
Set to false to prevent Browser Use from saving or honoring an Always allow approval on matching origins. Approvals for the current turn or thread can still apply. true makes Always allow available when otherwise permitted but does not create an approval.

browser_use.origins.<pattern>.uploads	allow | deny	
Use deny to block Browser Use uploads on matching origins. allow only lets normal approval and policy checks continue.

chatgpt_base_url	string	
Enforce the ChatGPT service base URL before authentication and cloud-policy retrieval. This doesn't configure every Codex network destination. Set through the local system requirements file or macOS MDM; cloud-managed values are ignored.

check_for_update_on_startup	boolean	
Enforce whether Codex checks for updates when it starts.

cli_auth_credentials_store	file | keyring | auto | ephemeral	
Enforce the CLI credential store before authentication loads. file uses CODEX_HOME/auth.json; keyring requires the OS credential store; auto falls back to a file if the credential store is unavailable; ephemeral keeps credentials in memory for the current process. Set through the local system requirements file or macOS MDM; cloud-managed values are ignored.

computer_use	table	
Managed requirements for agent-driven work in native desktop apps. Managed app rules and config.toml app rules are both enforced; an app must be allowed by each policy source.

computer_use.allow_locked_computer_use	boolean	
Set to false to prevent users from enabling Locked Use on a managed macOS device. This requirement removes the enablement controls; it does not turn off Locked Use if it is already enabled. If omitted, normal product availability applies.

computer_use.allow_persistent_approval	boolean	
Set to false to remove the option to save app approvals across sessions. Approvals for the current session remain available. Setting it to true or omitting it does not approve an app.

computer_use.default_app_access	allow | deny	
Fallback access for native apps that do not match a platform-specific rule. deny blocks access. allow only lets normal approval and policy checks continue. The product default is allow.

computer_use.macos	table	
Computer Use app rules for macOS.

computer_use.macos.bundle_ids	map<string, allow | deny>	
Map exact macOS bundle identifiers to allow or deny. A matching rule replaces computer_use.default_app_access within the same policy source. A deny from either managed requirements or user configuration still blocks access.

computer_use.macos.bundle_ids.<bundle-id>	allow | deny	
Use deny to block the exact bundle identifier. allow overrides only this policy source's default and still requires any other policy source and the normal approval flow to allow the app.

computer_use.windows	table	
Computer Use app rules for packaged and unpackaged Windows apps.

computer_use.windows.aumids	map<string, allow | deny>	
Map exact, registered Application User Model IDs (AUMIDs) for signed packaged apps to allow or deny. A matching rule replaces computer_use.default_app_access within the same policy source.

computer_use.windows.aumids.<aumid>	allow | deny	
Use deny to block the exact packaged-app identity. allow overrides only this policy source's default and still requires any other policy source and the normal approval flow to allow the app.

computer_use.windows.exes	array<table>	
Rules for signed, unpackaged Windows executables. Rules match the executable's verified publisher and signed version information, not its path or current file name. A matching deny takes precedence over matching allows. Unsigned executables use computer_use.default_app_access; executables whose signed identity cannot be verified unambiguously are blocked.

computer_use.windows.exes[].access	allow | deny	
Required access decision for matching executables. deny blocks access. allow overrides only this policy source's default and still requires any other policy source and the normal approval flow to allow the app.

computer_use.windows.exes[].binary_name	string	
Optional OriginalFilename from the executable's signed version information. Matching is case-insensitive. If a matching publisher and product rule requires this value but the executable does not provide it, Computer Use blocks the executable.

computer_use.windows.exes[].product_name	string	
Required exact ProductName from the executable's signed version information.

computer_use.windows.exes[].publisher_name	string	
Required exact publisher name from the executable's trusted signing certificate, formatted as a Windows X.500 distinguished name.

default_permissions	string	
Managed default permission profile. The profile must be allowed by allowed_permission_profiles. Set this explicitly for predictable behavior; if omitted, Codex defaults to :workspace only when both :workspace and :read-only are explicitly allowed.

enforce_residency	string	
Require Codex service traffic to use a supported data residency. Currently accepts us.

experimental_network	table	
Administrator-managed network requirements for sandboxed local commands, enforced from requirements.toml. When enabled, these requirements can start the command network proxy without features.network_proxy. Browser tools separately check managed network denies and exclusive allowlists. These requirements do not route browser traffic through the proxy or control web search, apps, MCP servers, native-app traffic, or Codex cloud networking.

experimental_network.allow_local_binding	boolean	
Permit broader local/private-network access for sandboxed networking. Exact local IP literal or localhost allow rules can still permit specific local targets when this stays false.

experimental_network.allow_upstream_proxy	boolean	
Allow sandboxed networking to chain through an upstream proxy from the environment.

experimental_network.allowed_domains	array<string>	
Administrator allow rules for sandboxed-command networking while the managed network proxy is enabled. These rules do not apply to web search, apps, or MCP servers. Do not combine this with experimental_network.domains.

experimental_network.dangerously_allow_all_unix_sockets	boolean	
Permit arbitrary Unix socket destinations instead of allowlist-only access. Use only in tightly controlled environments.

experimental_network.dangerously_allow_non_loopback_proxy	boolean	
Permit non-loopback listener addresses for [experimental_network] requirements. Enabling it can expose listeners beyond localhost.

experimental_network.denied_domains	array<string>	
List-shaped administrator deny rules for sandboxed networking. Do not combine this with experimental_network.domains.

experimental_network.domains	map<string, allow | deny>	
Map-shaped administrator domain policy for sandboxed networking. Supports exact hosts, *.example.com for subdomains only, **.example.com for apex plus subdomains, and global * allow rules; prefer scoped rules because * broadly opens public outbound access. deny wins on conflicts. Do not combine this with experimental_network.allowed_domains or experimental_network.denied_domains.

experimental_network.enabled	boolean	
Enable sandboxed networking requirements. This does not grant network access when the active sandbox keeps command networking off.

experimental_network.http_port	integer	
Loopback HTTP listener port to use for [experimental_network] requirements.

experimental_network.managed_allowed_domains_only	boolean	
When true, only administrator-managed allow rules remain effective while sandboxed networking requirements are active; user allowlist additions are ignored. Without managed allow rules, user-added domain allow rules do not remain effective.

experimental_network.socks_port	integer	
Loopback SOCKS5 listener port to use for [experimental_network] requirements.

experimental_network.unix_sockets	map<string, allow | deny>	
Administrator-managed Unix socket policy for sandboxed networking.

features	table	
Pinned feature values. Use canonical names from config.toml for runtime features; documented app-only requirement keys are also supported here.

features.<name>	boolean	
Require a documented runtime or app feature to stay enabled or disabled.

features.apps	boolean	
Pin Apps integration availability on or off for managed users.

features.browser_use	boolean	
Set to false in requirements.toml to disable agent-driven Browser Use.

features.browser_use_external	boolean	
Set to false in requirements.toml to prevent Codex from operating supported browsers through the ChatGPT browser extension, including existing tabs and signed-in sessions.

features.browser_use_full_cdp_access	boolean	
Set to false in requirements.toml to disable full Chrome DevTools Protocol access in the local runtime, including Browser Developer mode, and prevent the ChatGPT desktop app from enabling the corresponding setting. If omitted, normal product availability applies.

features.computer_use	boolean	
Set to false in requirements.toml to disable Computer Use, Record & Replay, and related install or enablement flows.

features.fast_mode	boolean	
Pin the canonical fast_mode feature on or off for managed users.

Admin-enforced managed lifecycle hooks. Requires a managed hook directory and uses the same event schema as inline [hooks] in config.toml.

hooks.<Event>	array<table>	
Matcher groups for a hook event such as PreToolUse, PermissionRequest, PostToolUse, PreCompact, PostCompact, SessionStart, SessionEnd, SubagentStart, SubagentStop, UserPromptSubmit, or Stop.

hooks.<Event>[].hooks	array<table>	
Hook handlers for a matcher group. Command and MCP tool hooks are supported while prompt and agent hook handlers are parsed but skipped.

hooks.<Event>[].hooks[].additionalContextLimit	integer	
Approximate per-handler token threshold for saving oversized additionalContext to disk and showing the model a shorter preview. Defaults to 2500; 0 passes the full context directly to the model. See Large hook output.

hooks.<Event>[].hooks[].async	boolean	
Run a command hook in the background without delaying the triggering operation. Defaults to false; SessionEnd always runs synchronously. See Run hooks in the background.

hooks.<Event>[].hooks[].commandWindows	string	
Windows-only command override for command hooks. The TOML alias command_windows is also accepted.

hooks.managed_dir	string (absolute path)	
Directory containing managed hook scripts on macOS and Linux. Codex validates that it is absolute and exists before loading managed hooks.

hooks.windows_managed_dir	string (absolute path)	
Directory containing managed hook scripts on Windows. Codex validates that it is absolute and exists before loading managed hooks.

in_app_browser	table	
Requirements for the built-in browser pane. These settings do not control agent-driven Browser Use.

in_app_browser.allow_external_browser_settings_import	boolean	
Set to false to prevent users from importing settings or browsing data from an external browser into the built-in browser. Setting it to true or omitting it leaves the import available when other product checks allow it. This is a managed-only setting with no config.toml override.

log_dir	string (path)	
Enforce the directory where Codex writes local log files.

marketplaces	table	
Admin requirements for plugin marketplace sources. Rules take effect when restrict_to_allowed_sources is true.

marketplaces.allowed_sources	table	
Allowed marketplace sources keyed by administrator-chosen rule name. Distinct names accumulate across requirements layers; fields under the same name use normal layer precedence.

marketplaces.allowed_sources.<name>	table	
One allowed source rule. The final source value after requirements merge determines which sibling fields Codex interprets.

marketplaces.allowed_sources.<name>.host_pattern	string	
Regular expression required when source = "host_pattern". Codex matches it against the lowercase hostname parsed from an HTTPS, SSH, or SCP-style Git source. Use ^ and $ to require a whole-host match.

marketplaces.allowed_sources.<name>.path	string (absolute path)	
Local marketplace directory required when source = "local". Codex requires an absolute path and compares paths after normalization.

marketplaces.allowed_sources.<name>.ref	string	
Optional exact Git ref for a git rule. When omitted, the rule allows any ref for the matching repository.

marketplaces.allowed_sources.<name>.source	git | host_pattern | local	
Marketplace source matcher type. Use git for one repository, host_pattern for Git hosts matched by regular expression, or local for one directory.

marketplaces.allowed_sources.<name>.url	string	
Git repository URL required when source = "git". Codex normalizes the configured and allowed URLs before requiring an exact repository match.

marketplaces.restrict_to_allowed_sources	boolean	
When true, require configured marketplace sources to match allowed_sources for marketplace add, plugin install, refresh, and runtime loading. OpenAI-curated Git catalogs, including the API-key catalog, must also match the allowlist. Bundled and remotely installed workspace plugins are separate from this curated Git source policy.

mcp_servers	table

models.new_thread	table	
Optional defaults to apply when a new local thread starts. They take priority over user and project defaults, but can be superseded by explicit overrides.

models.new_thread.model	string	
Default model for new threads. An explicit override of either the model or reasoning effort causes both fields to be ignored.

models.new_thread.model_reasoning_effort	string	
Default reasoning effort for new threads. An explicit override of either the model or reasoning effort causes both fields to be ignored.

models.new_thread.service_tier	string

permissions.filesystem.deny_read	array<string>	
Admin-enforced filesystem read denials. Entries can be paths or glob patterns, and users cannot weaken them with local config.

plugins	table	
Plugin-specific MCP server allowlists keyed by plugin identifier. When this table is present, plugin-bundled servers without a matching plugin and server entry are disabled.

plugins.<plugin>.mcp_servers	table	
Allowlist for MCP servers bundled with one plugin. Plugin server requirements use the same exact identity and matcher forms as top-level mcp_servers requirements.
