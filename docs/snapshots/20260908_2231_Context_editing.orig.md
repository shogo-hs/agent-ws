Markdown Content:
Automatically manage conversation context as it grows with context editing.

## Overview

Context editing allows you to selectively clear specific content from conversation history as it grows. Beyond optimizing costs and staying within limits, this is about actively curating what Claude sees: context is a finite resource with diminishing returns, and irrelevant content degrades model focus. Context editing gives you fine-grained runtime control over that curation. For the broader principles behind context management, see [Effective context engineering](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-context-engineering-for-ai-agents). This page covers:

*   **Tool result clearing** - Best for agentic workflows with heavy tool use where old tool results are no longer needed
*   **Thinking block clearing** - For managing thinking blocks when using extended thinking, with options to preserve recent thinking for context continuity
*   **Client-side SDK compaction** - An SDK-based alternative for summary-based context management (server-side compaction is generally preferred)

| Approach | Where it runs | Strategies | How it works |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Server-side** | API | Tool result clearing (`clear_tool_uses_20250919`) Thinking block clearing (`clear_thinking_20251015`) | Applied before the prompt reaches Claude. Clears specific content from conversation history. Each strategy can be configured independently. |
| **Client-side** | SDK | Compaction | Available in [TypeScript and Ruby SDKs](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/cli-sdks-libraries/overview) when using [`tool_runner`](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/tool-runner). Generates a summary and replaces full conversation history. See [Client-side compaction](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/context-editing#client-side-compaction-sdk). |

## Server-side strategies

### Tool result clearing

The `clear_tool_uses_20250919` strategy clears tool results when conversation context grows beyond your configured threshold. This is particularly useful for agentic workflows with heavy tool use. Older tool results (like file contents or search results) are no longer needed once Claude has processed them.

When activated, the API automatically clears the oldest tool results in chronological order. The API replaces each cleared result with placeholder text indicating to Claude that it was removed. By default, only tool results are cleared. You can optionally clear both tool results and tool calls (the tool use parameters) by setting `clear_tool_inputs` to true.

### Thinking block clearing

The `clear_thinking_20251015` strategy manages `thinking` blocks in conversations when extended thinking is enabled. This strategy gives you control over thinking preservation: you can choose to keep more thinking blocks to maintain reasoning continuity, or clear them more aggressively to save context space.

An assistant conversation turn may include multiple content blocks (for example, when using tools) and multiple thinking blocks (for example, with [interleaved thinking](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/thinking#interleaved-thinking)).

### Context editing happens server-side

Context editing is applied server-side before the prompt reaches Claude. Your client application maintains the full, unmodified conversation history. You do not need to sync your client state with the edited version. Continue managing your full conversation history locally as you normally would.

On Claude Fable 5.1, server-side context management never invalidates thinking blocks. Client-side edits to earlier turns can invalidate the thinking blocks in every later assistant turn. For new accounts created on or after August 31, 2026, a request that replays an invalidated block is rejected unless you opt into dropping it. See [Preserved thinking](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/thinking#preserved-in-conversation).

### Context editing and prompt caching

Context editing's interaction with [prompt caching](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-caching) varies by strategy:

*   **Tool result clearing:** Invalidates cached prompt prefixes when content is cleared. To account for this, clear enough tokens to make the cache invalidation worthwhile. Use the `clear_at_least` parameter to ensure a minimum number of tokens is cleared each time. You'll incur cache write costs each time content is cleared, but subsequent requests can reuse the newly cached prefix.

*   **Thinking block clearing:** When thinking blocks are **kept** in context (not cleared), the prompt cache is preserved, enabling cache hits and reducing input token costs. When thinking blocks are **cleared**, the cache is invalidated at the point where clearing occurs. Configure the `keep` parameter based on whether you want to prioritize cache performance or context window availability.

## Supported models

Context editing is available on all supported Claude models.

## Tool result clearing usage

The simplest way to enable tool result clearing is to specify only the strategy type. All other [configuration options](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/context-editing#configuration-options-for-tool-result-clearing) use their default values:

### Advanced configuration

You can customize the tool result clearing behavior with additional parameters:

## Thinking block clearing usage

Enable thinking block clearing to manage context and prompt caching effectively when extended thinking is enabled:

### Configuration options for thinking block clearing

The `clear_thinking_20251015` strategy supports the following configuration:

| Configuration option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `keep` | Model-specific | Defines how many recent assistant turns with thinking blocks to preserve. Use `{type: "thinking_turns", value: N}` where N must be > 0 to keep the last N turns, or `"all"` to keep all thinking blocks. Opus 4.5+ and Sonnet 4.6+: all turns. Fable and Mythos models: all turns. Earlier Opus/Sonnet and all Haiku: last turn only. |

**Example configurations:**

Keep thinking blocks from the last 3 assistant turns:

Keep all thinking blocks (maximizes cache hits):

### Combining strategies

You can use both thinking block clearing and tool result clearing together:

## Configuration options for tool result clearing

| Configuration option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `trigger` | 100,000 input tokens | Defines when the context editing strategy activates. Once the prompt exceeds this threshold, clearing begins. You can specify this value in either `input_tokens` or `tool_uses`. |
| `keep` | 3 tool uses | Defines how many recent tool use/result pairs to keep after clearing occurs. The API removes the oldest tool interactions first, preserving the most recent ones. |
| `clear_at_least` | None | Ensures a minimum number of tokens is cleared each time the strategy activates. If the API can't clear at least the specified amount, the strategy will not be applied. This helps determine if context clearing is worth breaking your prompt cache. |
| `exclude_tools` | None | List of tool names whose tool uses and results should never be cleared. Useful for preserving important context. |
| `clear_tool_inputs` | `false` | Controls whether the tool call parameters are cleared along with the tool results. By default, only the tool results are cleared while keeping Claude's original tool calls visible. |

## Context editing response

You can see which context edits were applied to your request using the `context_management` response field, along with helpful statistics about the content and input tokens cleared.

For streaming responses, the context edits are included in the final `message_delta` event:

## Token counting

The [token counting](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/token-counting) endpoint supports context management, allowing you to preview how many tokens your prompt will use after context editing is applied.

The response shows both the final token count after context management is applied (`input_tokens`) and the original token count before any clearing occurred (`original_input_tokens`).

## Using with the memory tool

Context editing can be combined with the [memory tool](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/memory-tool). When your conversation context approaches the configured clearing threshold, Claude receives an automatic warning to preserve important information. This enables Claude to save tool results or context to its memory files before they're cleared from the conversation history.

This combination allows you to:

*   **Preserve important context:** Claude can write essential information from tool results to memory files before those results are cleared
*   **Maintain long-running workflows:** Enable agentic workflows that would otherwise exceed context limits by offloading information to persistent storage
*   **Access information on demand:** Claude can look up previously cleared information from memory files when needed, rather than keeping everything in the active context window

For example, in a file editing workflow where Claude performs many operations, Claude can summarize completed changes to memory files as the context grows. When tool results are cleared, Claude retains access to that information through its memory system and can continue working effectively.

To use both features together, enable them in your API request:

For the full memory tool reference including commands and examples, see [Memory tool](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/memory-tool).

## Client-side compaction (SDK)

Compaction is an SDK feature that automatically manages conversation context by generating summaries when token usage grows too large. Unlike server-side context editing strategies that clear content, compaction instructs Claude to summarize the conversation history, then replaces the full history with that summary. This allows Claude to continue working on long-running tasks that would otherwise exceed the [context window](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/context-windows).

### How compaction works

When compaction is enabled, the SDK monitors token usage after each model response:

1.   **Threshold check:** The SDK calculates total tokens as `input_tokens + cache_creation_input_tokens + cache_read_input_tokens + output_tokens` (see [Prompt caching](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-caching) for the cache token fields).
2.   **Summary generation:** When the threshold is exceeded, a summary prompt is injected as a user turn, and Claude generates a structured summary wrapped in `<summary></summary>` tags.
3.   **Context replacement:** The SDK extracts the summary and replaces the entire message history with it.
4.   **Continuation:** The conversation resumes from the summary, with Claude picking up where it left off.

### Using compaction

Add `compaction_control` to your `tool_runner` call to enable automatic summarization when token usage exceeds the threshold.

#### What occurs during compaction

As the conversation grows, the message history accumulates:

**Before compaction (approaching 100k tokens):**

When tokens exceed the threshold, the SDK injects a summary request and Claude generates a summary. The entire history is then replaced:

**After compaction (back to ~2–3k tokens):**

Claude continues working from this summary as if it were the original conversation history.

### Configuration options

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled` | boolean | Yes | - | Whether to enable automatic compaction |
| `context_token_threshold` | number | No | 100,000 | Token count at which compaction triggers |
| `model` | string | No | Same as main model | Model to use for generating summaries |
| `summary_prompt` | string | No | See [Default summary prompt](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/context-editing#default-summary-prompt) | Custom prompt for summary generation |

#### Choosing a token threshold

The threshold determines when compaction occurs. A lower threshold means more frequent compactions with smaller context windows. A higher threshold allows more context but risks hitting limits.

#### Using a different model for summaries

You can use a faster or cheaper model for generating summaries:

#### Custom summary prompts

You can provide a custom prompt for domain-specific needs. Your prompt should instruct Claude to wrap its summary in `<summary></summary>` tags.

### Default summary prompt

The built-in summary prompt instructs Claude to create a structured continuation summary including:

1.   **Task Overview:** The user's core request, success criteria, and constraints.
2.   **Current State:** What has been completed, files modified, and artifacts produced.
3.   **Important Discoveries:** Technical constraints, decisions made, errors resolved, and failed approaches.
4.   **Next Steps:** Specific actions needed, blockers, and priority order.
5.   **Context to Preserve:** User preferences, domain-specific details, and commitments made.

This structure enables Claude to resume work efficiently without losing important context or repeating mistakes.

### Limitations

#### Server-side tools

When using server-side tools, the SDK may incorrectly calculate token usage, causing compaction to trigger at the wrong time.

For example, after a web search operation, the API response might show:

The SDK calculates total usage as 63,000 + 0 + 270,000 + 1,400 = 334,400 tokens. However, the `cache_read_input_tokens` value includes accumulated reads from multiple internal API calls made by the server-side tool, not your actual conversation context. Your real context length might only be the 63,000 `input_tokens`, but the SDK sees 334k and triggers compaction prematurely.

**Workarounds:**

*   Use the [token counting](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/token-counting) endpoint to get accurate context length
*   Avoid compaction when using server-side tools extensively

#### Tool use edge cases

When the SDK triggers compaction while a tool use response is pending, it removes the tool use block from the message history before generating the summary. Claude will re-issue the tool call after resuming from the summary if still needed.

### Monitoring compaction

Understanding when compaction triggers helps you tune thresholds and verify expected behavior.

### When to use compaction

**Good use cases:**

*   Long-running agent tasks that process many files or data sources
*   Research workflows that accumulate large amounts of information
*   Multistep tasks with clear, measurable progress
*   Tasks that produce artifacts (files, reports) that persist outside the conversation

**Less ideal use cases:**

*   Tasks requiring precise recall of early conversation details
*   Workflows using server-side tools extensively
*   Tasks that need to maintain exact state across many variables

## Next steps

Manage long conversations with server-side compaction, the recommended strategy for most use cases.

Reduce cost and latency by caching prompt prefixes, and learn how context editing interacts with the cache.
