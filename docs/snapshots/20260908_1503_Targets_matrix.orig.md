Markdown Content:
The canonical reference for what APM deploys, where, for every supported harness. Use this page to choose a target, debug an unexpected deploy location, or confirm whether a primitive is supported on a given tool.

For background on the target model, see [Primitives and targets](https://microsoft.github.io/apm/concepts/primitives-and-targets/). For the runtime CLI surface, see [`apm targets`](https://microsoft.github.io/apm/reference/cli/targets/) and [`apm compile`](https://microsoft.github.io/apm/reference/cli/compile/). For the primitive types themselves, see [Primitive types](https://microsoft.github.io/apm/reference/primitive-types/).

| Target | Deploy root | instructions | prompts | agents | skills | commands | hooks | mcp |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| copilot | `.github/` | [x] | [x] | [x] | [x] | [ ] | [x] | [x] |
| claude | `.claude/` | [x] | [ ] | [x] | [x] | [x] | [x] | [x] |

Skills deploy to `.agents/skills/` for Copilot, Cursor, OpenCode, Gemini, Antigravity, Codex, Hermes project scope, and Windsurf by default (see [Skills convergence](https://microsoft.github.io/apm/reference/targets-matrix/#skills-convergence) below). Claude, Grok Build, Kiro, and Hermes user scope keep target-native skill directories.

(*) For `intellij`, file primitives route through the Copilot profile: instructions, prompts, agents, and hooks use `.github/`, while skills use `.agents/skills/`. The IntelliJ-specific adapter configures MCP only.

`copilot-cowork` (Microsoft 365 Copilot), `copilot-app` (GitHub Copilot desktop App), `grok-cloud` (xAI Grok Cloud), and `openclaw` (OpenClaw agent runtime) are gated behind experimental flags and not listed above. Hermes is stable but explicit-only. See [Experimental](https://microsoft.github.io/apm/reference/experimental/).

## Post-install instruction compilation

[Section titled “Post-install instruction compilation”](https://microsoft.github.io/apm/reference/targets-matrix/#post-install-instruction-compilation)

After a project install stages dependency instructions, the APM CLI requires a separate root-context compile for `codex`, `gemini`, `opencode`, and `hermes`. It emits the [`req-tg-007`](https://microsoft.github.io/apm/specs/openapm-v01/#req-tg-007) reminder for those targets. All other targets in this matrix either deploy instructions as native per-file rules, do not support dependency instructions, or have no verified root-context reader, so they do not trigger that reminder. A target not classified here does not trigger it by default.

## Detection and resolution

[Section titled “Detection and resolution”](https://microsoft.github.io/apm/reference/targets-matrix/#detection-and-resolution)

`apm install` and `apm compile` resolve the active target list with this priority:

1.   `--target` / `--all` on the command line.
2.   `targets:` in `apm.yml`.
3.   Auto-detection from filesystem signals (table below).

For MCP installation, the equivalent explicit legacy `--runtime` flag also has highest priority. MCP machine discovery runs only when `targets:` is omitted (or legacy `all` is treated as omission). Declared targets therefore produce portable MCP ownership in `apm.lock.yaml`; omitted targets intentionally make that ownership machine-dependent.

`apm install` fails closed when no target can be detected. `apm compile` retains its documented unsignalled fallback because install writes runtime-specific configuration while compile only generates project output. Use [`apm targets`](https://microsoft.github.io/apm/reference/cli/targets/) to preview the resolved list.

### Detection signal whitelist

[Section titled “Detection signal whitelist”](https://microsoft.github.io/apm/reference/targets-matrix/#detection-signal-whitelist)

| Target | Signals (any one activates the target) |
| --- | --- |
| copilot | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file, or `.github/instructions/`, `.github/agents/`, `.github/prompts/`, or `.github/hooks/` directory |
| claude | `.claude/` directory, or `CLAUDE.md` file |
| grok-build | `.grok/` directory |
| cursor | `.cursor/` directory, or `.cursorrules` file |
| codex | `.codex/` directory |
| gemini | `.gemini/` directory, or `GEMINI.md` file |
| opencode | `.opencode/` directory |
| windsurf | `.windsurf/` directory |
| kiro | `.kiro/` directory |
| intellij | Global `github-copilot/intellij/` config directory (MCP runtime discovery only) |

IntelliJ-specific integration is MCP-only and writes JetBrains Copilot’s user-scope `mcp.json`. That global signal does not auto-select file-primitive deployment. When `intellij` is selected explicitly, package file primitives use the Copilot profile. `intellij` does not participate in plain `all` expansion.

`agent-skills` and `hermes` are canonical target keys; `antigravity` and `hermes` are explicit-only for auto-detection. All are available with `--target` and can be listed in a project’s `apm.yml``targets:` field so contributors running plain `apm install` pick them up automatically.

`copilot-cowork`, `copilot-app`, `grok-cloud`, and `openclaw` are experimental targets that require `apm experimental enable <name>` before use. They are selected with `--target` only and cannot be listed in `apm.yml` (the canonical targets validator will reject them).

GitHub Copilot (CLI and IDE).

*   **Detection.**`.github/copilot-instructions.md`.
*   **Deploy directory.**`.github/` at project scope; `~/.copilot/` at user scope.
*   **Supported primitives.** instructions, prompts, agents, skills, hooks, mcp.
*   **File conventions.**
    *   instructions: `.github/instructions/<name>.instructions.md`
    *   prompts: `.github/prompts/<name>.prompt.md`
    *   agents: `.github/agents/<name>.agent.md`
    *   skills: `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` at project scope and `~/.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` at user scope
    *   hooks: `.github/hooks/<name>.json`
    *   generated: `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (compile output)

*   **User scope.** Partial. `prompts` deploy under `~/.copilot/prompts/`; `instructions` from all packages are concatenated into `~/.copilot/copilot-instructions.md` (Copilot CLI reads only that single file at user scope). User-scope deploys land under `~/.copilot/`, not `~/.github/`; hook script commands are written as absolute paths so Copilot CLI can invoke them from any working directory.
*   **Global compile.**`apm compile -g` can also render global instructions to `~/.copilot/AGENTS.md` for root-context readers that honor `AGENTS.md`.

Claude Code.

*   **Detection.**`.claude/` directory, or `CLAUDE.md`.
*   **Deploy directory.**`.claude/` (project and user scope; user scope honors `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` if set).
*   **Supported primitives.** instructions, agents, skills, commands, hooks, mcp. (No `prompts`.)
*   **File conventions.**
    *   instructions: deployed directly by `apm install` to `.claude/rules/<name>.md`
    *   agents: `.claude/agents/<name>.md`
    *   commands: `.claude/commands/<name>.md`
    *   skills: `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
    *   hooks: merged into `.claude/settings.json`

*   **Compile output.**`CLAUDE.md`; instructions already deployed under `.claude/rules/` are omitted from `CLAUDE.md` to avoid duplicate context.

Cursor.

*   **Detection.**`.cursor/` directory, or legacy `.cursorrules` file.
*   **Deploy directory.**`.cursor/`.
*   **Supported primitives.** instructions, agents, skills, commands, hooks, mcp. (No `prompts`.)
*   **File conventions.**
    *   instructions: `.cursor/rules/<name>.mdc`
    *   agents: `.cursor/agents/<name>.md`
    *   commands: `.cursor/commands/<name>.md`
    *   skills: `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (project) or `~/.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (user)
    *   hooks: `.cursor/hooks.json`

*   **User scope.** Partial. `instructions` is excluded at user scope; Cursor reads global rules from its Settings UI rather than from disk.
*   **Global compile.**`apm compile -g` can render global instructions to `~/.cursor/AGENTS.md` for root-context readers that honor `AGENTS.md`; Cursor global rules still use the Settings UI.
*   **Caveat.** Command files use the shared `claude_command` transformer today; Cursor-specific frontmatter keys (`author`, `mcp`, `parameters`, …) are dropped at install time and surfaced via diagnostics.

OpenAI Codex CLI.

*   **Detection.**`.codex/` directory.
*   **Deploy directory.**`.codex/` plus `.agents/` for skills.
*   **Supported primitives.** agents, skills, hooks, mcp. (No `instructions`, `prompts`, or `commands`.)
*   **File conventions.**
    *   agents: `.codex/agents/<name>.toml`
    *   skills: `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
    *   hooks: `.codex/hooks.json`

*   **Compile output.**`AGENTS.md` only. Per-file instructions are not installed for Codex.

Gemini CLI.

*   **Detection.**`.gemini/` directory, or `GEMINI.md`.
*   **Deploy directory.**`.gemini/` (project and user scope).
*   **Supported primitives.** commands, skills, hooks, mcp.
*   **File conventions.**
    *   commands: `.gemini/commands/<name>.toml`
    *   skills: `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
    *   hooks: merged into `.gemini/settings.json`

*   **Compile output.**`GEMINI.md`. Gemini CLI does not read per-file rules from `.gemini/rules/`, so `instructions` is compile-only.

Google Antigravity CLI (`agy`), successor to Gemini CLI.

*   **Detection.** None – explicit-only for auto-detection. Antigravity shares the cross-tool `.agents/` root, so there is no unique auto-detect signal. Select it with `--target antigravity` or list it in `apm.yml``targets:`; it is not part of `--target all`. Project-scope MCP writes are opt-in: `.agents/` must already exist (APM does not create it automatically for MCP).
*   **Deploy directory.**`.agents/` (project scope); `~/.gemini/` (user scope).
*   **Supported primitives.** instructions, skills, hooks, mcp.
*   **File conventions.**
    *   instructions: `.agents/rules/<name>.md` (formatted natively with `trigger: glob` and `globs` frontmatter mapped from the package `applyTo` patterns)
    *   skills: `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
    *   hooks: `.agents/hooks.json` (Antigravity’s native schema: `PreToolUse`/`PostToolUse`/`PreInvocation`/`PostInvocation`/`Stop`)
    *   mcp: `.agents/mcp_config.json` (project; `mcpServers` key) or `~/.gemini/config/mcp_config.json` (user)

*   **Compile output.**`AGENTS.md`. Supports compilation deduplication: if `.agents/rules/` exists and contains at least one deployed instruction rule file (for the discovered `.apm/instructions/*.instructions.md` set), those instructions are omitted from `AGENTS.md` to avoid duplicate context.

OpenCode.

*   **Detection.**`.opencode/` directory.
*   **Deploy directory.**`.opencode/` at project scope; `~/.config/opencode/` at user scope.
*   **Supported primitives.** agents, commands, skills, mcp.
*   **File conventions.**
    *   agents: `.opencode/agents/<name>.md`
    *   commands: `.opencode/commands/<name>.md`
    *   skills: `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (project) or `~/.config/opencode/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (user)

*   **Caveat.** OpenCode has no hooks concept; the `hooks` primitive is silently skipped for this target.
*   **Global compile.**`apm compile -g` writes `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md`. OpenCode also retains `applyTo` sections in that generated file; other user-root targets compile only global instructions.

Windsurf / Cascade.

*   **Detection.**`.windsurf/` directory.
*   **Deploy directory.** Native primitives deploy under `.windsurf/` at project scope and `~/.codeium/windsurf/` at user scope; skills converge on `.agents/skills/` at both scopes (`~/.agents/skills/` at user scope).
*   **Supported primitives.** instructions, skills, commands, hooks, mcp.
*   **File conventions.**
    *   instructions: `.windsurf/rules/<name>.md`
    *   skills: `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
    *   commands: `.windsurf/workflows/<name>.md`
    *   hooks: `.windsurf/hooks.json`

*   **Agents.** Not deployed. Cascade auto-invokes any `SKILL.md` by its `description:` frontmatter, so a separate agents primitive would collide with skills on the same path. Ship personas as skills under `.apm/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` instead.
*   **User scope.** Partial. `instructions` is excluded at user scope; Windsurf stores global memory in a single `~/.codeium/windsurf/memories/global_rules.md` file with a different format.

Kiro IDE/CLI v3 unified agent harness.

*   **Detection.**`.kiro/` directory.
*   **Deploy directory.**`.kiro/` (project and user scope).
*   **Supported primitives.** agents, instructions, skills, hooks, mcp.
*   **File conventions.**
    *   agents: `.kiro/agents/<relative-stem>.md` – identity derives from the relative path. Only `description`, `model`, and `tools` frontmatter are emitted; `name` and unknown fields are stripped. Tools are permission-bearing: APM fails closed (no partial write) if any tool value is outside the approved set (`read`, `write`, `shell`, `web`, `subagent`, `knowledge`, `context`, `todo_list`, `@mcp`, `@builtin`, `*`). Kiro may warn and fall back if the specified `model` is unavailable; APM passes model values through without validation. Ref: [kiro.dev/docs/custom-agents/](https://kiro.dev/docs/custom-agents/) (accessed 2026-08-03).
    *   instructions: `.kiro/steering/<name>.md` with `inclusion: always` or `inclusion: fileMatch` frontmatter
    *   skills: `.kiro/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
    *   hooks: one JSON file per hook action under `.kiro/hooks/`
    *   mcp: `.kiro/settings/mcp.json` (project) or `~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json` (user)

*   **MCP shape.** JSON `mcpServers` entries use `command`/`args`/`env` for stdio and `url`/`headers` for remote servers. Kiro resolves `${VAR}` placeholders at runtime, so APM preserves them rather than writing secrets to disk.
*   **Scope.** Covers the documented Kiro IDE and CLI v3 layout (unified harness). Ref: [kiro.dev/docs/cli/v3/](https://kiro.dev/docs/cli/v3/) (accessed 2026-08-03).

GitHub Copilot for JetBrains IDEs.

*   **Detection.** MCP runtime discovery uses the global `github-copilot/intellij/` config directory. It does not auto-select a file-primitive target.
*   **Deploy directory.** User-scope `mcp.json`; see the [JetBrains integration guide](https://microsoft.github.io/apm/integrations/ide-tool-integration/#jetbrains-intellij-idea-pycharm-goland-and-others) for OS-specific paths. macOS and Linux use `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` (default `~/.config`), while Windows uses `%LOCALAPPDATA%`.
*   **Supported primitives.** The IntelliJ-specific adapter supports MCP. Instructions, prompts, agents, and hooks deploy through the Copilot profile under `.github/`; skills deploy under `.agents/skills/`.
*   **Scope.** MCP configuration is user scope only. File primitives use the project or user scope selected for the Copilot profile. IntelliJ does not participate in plain `all` expansion.

Cross-client shared skills directory.

*   **Detection.** Never auto-detected. Select with `--target agent-skills`.
*   **Deploy directory.**`.agents/`.
*   **Supported primitives.** skills only.
*   **File conventions.**`.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`.
*   **Use case.** Author-time target for shipping a SKILL bundle that any Skills-aware client (Codex, Copilot CLI, Claude Code, etc.) can read without per-tool deployment.

Hermes Agent.

*   **Detection.** Never auto-detected. Select with `--target hermes` or list it in `apm.yml`.
*   **Deploy directory.** Project-scope skills use `.agents/skills/`. User-scope skills and MCP servers use `$HERMES_HOME` (default `~/.hermes`).
*   **Supported primitives.** skills, mcp, and compiled instructions.
*   **File conventions.**
    *   skills: `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (project) or `$HERMES_HOME/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (user)
    *   mcp: `$HERMES_HOME/config.yaml` under the `mcp_servers:` block
    *   compiled instructions: `AGENTS.md`

*   **Compile behavior.**`apm compile --target hermes` emits `AGENTS.md`.

[Grok Build](https://github.com/xai-org/grok-build) native configuration.

*   **Detection.** Auto-detected when `.grok/` exists.
*   **Selection.** Included in `all`; no experimental flag is required.
*   **Deploy directory.**`.grok/` at project scope; `~/.grok/` at user scope.
*   **Supported primitives.** instructions, agents, commands, and skills.
*   **File conventions.**`.grok/rules/*.md`, `.grok/agents/*.md`, `.grok/commands/*.md`, and `.grok/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`.
*   **Compile behavior.** Produces `AGENTS.md`.

## grok-cloud (experimental)

[Section titled “grok-cloud (experimental)”](https://microsoft.github.io/apm/reference/targets-matrix/#grok-cloud-experimental)

xAI Grok Cloud skills deployment.

*   **Detection.** Never auto-detected. After enabling the experimental flag, selecting `--target grok-cloud` creates the deploy directory when needed.
*   **Enable.**`apm experimental enable grok-cloud`.
*   **Deploy directory.**`.grok/` at project scope; `~/.grok/` at user scope.
*   **Supported primitives.** skills only.
*   **File conventions.**`.grok/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`.
*   **Compile behavior.**`apm compile --target grok-cloud` is a successful no-op.

## openclaw (experimental)

[Section titled “openclaw (experimental)”](https://microsoft.github.io/apm/reference/targets-matrix/#openclaw-experimental)

[OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) agent runtime.

*   **Detection.** Never auto-detected. Select with `--target openclaw` after enabling the experimental flag.
*   **Enable.**`apm experimental enable openclaw`.
*   **Deploy directory.**`.agents/skills/` at project scope (identical to `agent-skills`); `~/.openclaw/skills/` at user scope (`--global`).
*   **Supported primitives.** skills only.
*   **File conventions.**`.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (project) or `~/.openclaw/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (user).
*   **Note.** At project scope the output is identical to `agent-skills`. The `--global` user path is the distinguishing capability, deploying skills where OpenClaw reads its managed/local skill directory (priority 4 in the OpenClaw loading order).

## Skills convergence

[Section titled “Skills convergence”](https://microsoft.github.io/apm/reference/targets-matrix/#skills-convergence)

Most targets with a `skills` primitive deploy to `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. Claude, Grok Build, Kiro, and experimental Grok Cloud keep target-native skill directories.

To restore the pre-convergence per-target layout (skills land under each target’s own root), use the `--legacy-skill-paths` flag on `apm install` or set `APM_LEGACY_SKILL_PATHS=1`.

MCP is not a `TargetProfile` primitive; it is wired by a separate integrator that writes per-client config files (e.g. `.vscode/mcp.json`, `.cursor/mcp.json`, `.claude.json`, `.kiro/settings/mcp.json`) for every target in the active set that has an MCP client adapter. Active set follows the same `--target`>`targets:`> auto-detect chain as `apm install`: a runtime with an adapter but outside the active set is skipped and APM emits an `[i] Skipped MCP config for X  (active targets: Y)` line so the gate decision is observable. The matrix above marks `mcp` supported when an adapter exists; whether the config gets written on a given install is a function of the active target set, not just adapter availability. See [Install MCP servers](https://microsoft.github.io/apm/consumer/install-mcp-servers/) for the gate behavior and [`apm mcp`](https://microsoft.github.io/apm/reference/cli/mcp/) for the runtime surface.
