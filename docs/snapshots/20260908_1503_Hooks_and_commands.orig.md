Title: Hooks and commands

Markdown Content:
Hooks and slash commands are the two APM primitives that do not pretend to be portable. Unlike skills or instructions, they ship to a strict subset of harnesses, never get folded into `AGENTS.md`, and rely on each target’s own format. Author them when the value to a specific harness justifies the per-target maintenance.

This page covers both. For the cross-harness reach map, see [Primitives and targets](https://microsoft.github.io/apm/concepts/primitives-and-targets/). For dev-only versus prod separation in the manifest, see [Dev-only primitives](https://microsoft.github.io/apm/concepts/primitives-and-targets/#dev-only-primitives).

## Why they are target-specific

[Section titled “Why they are target-specific”](https://microsoft.github.io/apm/producer/author-primitives/hooks-and-commands/#why-they-are-target-specific)

A skill is a markdown file APM can route to every canonical skill target. A hook is a runtime callback fired by one harness inside its own tool loop. A slash command is a command-palette entry surfaced by an IDE. Neither generalizes: nothing reaches `AGENTS.md`, nothing routes to harnesses that lack the concept. Unsupported targets are silently skipped, not errors. Treat both as opt-in surface, not as your primary distribution path.

Source layout. APM discovers hook JSON files in either of two directories at the package root:

`your-package/+-- .apm/|   +-- hooks/|       +-- pretool-validate.json+-- hooks/                      # also discovered (Claude-native layout)    +-- post-edit-format.json`

Each file is a JSON document keyed by lifecycle event. APM accepts the Claude (`PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`) and Copilot (`preToolUse`, `postToolUse`) shapes; events are renamed per target during merge.

### Session lifecycle event aliases

[Section titled “Session lifecycle event aliases”](https://microsoft.github.io/apm/producer/author-primitives/hooks-and-commands/#session-lifecycle-event-aliases)

| Source aliases | Copilot native key | Claude native key |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SessionStart`, `sessionStart` | `sessionStart` | `SessionStart` |
| `Stop`, `AgentStop`, `agentStop` | `agentStop` | `Stop` |

Event names absent from this table are preserved unchanged. Only an unmapped camelCase or PascalCase name that conflicts with the target convention emits an install warning. All-lowercase names such as `stop` pass through silently; `stop` is not a native Copilot or Claude event and will not fire.

`{  "hooks": {    "PreToolUse": [      {        "hooks": [          {"type": "command", "command": "${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/validate.sh", "timeout": 10}        ]      }    ]  }}`

APM also accepts the “naked” Claude settings-slice shape – event names at the top level with no outer `"hooks":` wrap. This is the literal shape Claude Code accepts inside its own `settings.json`, so a hooks slice copied straight from there works as a standalone APM hook file:

`{  "PreToolUse": [    {      "hooks": [        {"type": "command", "command": "${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/validate.sh", "timeout": 10}      ]    }  ]}`

Both shapes are normalized internally before merge. A file whose `"hooks"` key is present but not a JSON object fails closed with a warning; a file that parses cleanly but contributes zero entries also logs a warning so authors notice empty merges during development.

The `${PLUGIN_ROOT}`, `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`, `${CURSOR_PLUGIN_ROOT}`, and `${KIRO_PLUGIN_ROOT}` tokens resolve to the installed package root and are rewritten per target. Plain `./script.sh` resolves relative to the hook file. If the hook file lives in `hooks/` or `.apm/hooks/`, a path like `./hooks/run-hook.sh` resolves from the package root so the deployed path is not doubled.

Quote the complete path when it may contain spaces: `"${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/my hook.sh"`. A split-quoted path such as `"${PLUGIN_ROOT}"/scripts/my\ hook.sh` is also accepted. If a supported plugin-root token cannot be resolved, install names the package and explains whether to balance the quotes, add a relative path, or keep the path inside the package. Fix the package hook command, then run `apm install` again.

When a hook command points at a script inside a package hook directory, APM deploys the hook source bundle so sibling helper modules stay available at runtime:

*   Claude-family merged targets (Claude, Cursor, Codex, Gemini, Antigravity, and Windsurf), Copilot, and Kiro receive the same bundle.
*   Root hook JSON descriptors, symlinks, and `.apm-pin` markers are not deployed.
*   JavaScript and TypeScript hook bundles get a minimal `package.json` sidecar with the nearest source package’s Node `type`; packages without an explicit `type` deploy as `commonjs`, and shell-only bundles do not get a sidecar. **Exception – Copilot and VS Code:** APM does not write the sidecar into project `.github/hooks/scripts/` or user `~/.copilot/hooks/scripts/` because Copilot’s hook loader scans those directories recursively and rejects any JSON file that lacks a `hooks` key. APM also omits nested JSON bundle assets for these targets; keep hook runtime configuration in a non-JSON format. For ES module scripts targeting Copilot or VS Code, use the `.mjs` file extension – Node.js recognises it without a `package.json`.

Use simple hook filenames. APM computes their reach as:

`effective hook targets =  project active targets  INTERSECT consumer per-dependency targets (when set)  INTERSECT package targets (when restrictive)`

Every selector is a filter. A package declaration only narrows the consumer-authorized active set; it never activates a target or expands dependency reach. Omitting package `target:` / `targets:`, or using the legacy `all` value, adds no package restriction; `all` is not expanded into an additional target set at this gate.

For example, this package can write hooks only to Claude:

`name: claude-hooksversion: "1.0.0"target: claude`

`target:` accepts scalar, CSV, and list spellings, including aliases such as `vscode` (normalized to `copilot`). `targets:` accepts a scalar or list of canonical names. Unknown names, both keys together, and an empty or null `targets:` value fail validation. A null singular `target:` is treated as omission for legacy compatibility; an empty string or list fails validation. Both keys conflict even when either value is null. Consumers can narrow one dependency further with object-form `targets:`.

If the same manifest stem is mirrored in both `hooks/` and `.apm/hooks/`, APM integrates the `.apm/hooks/` copy once per target.

Supported targets and where the integrator writes:

| Target | Output | Mode |
| --- | --- | --- |
| copilot | `.github/hooks/<pkg>-<name>.json` | one file per hook |
| claude | `.claude/settings.json` | merged into settings |
| grok-build | – not supported – | silently skipped |
| cursor | `.cursor/hooks.json` | merged |
| gemini | `.gemini/settings.json` | merged |
| codex | `.codex/hooks.json` | merged |
| windsurf | `.windsurf/hooks.json` | merged |
| kiro | `.kiro/hooks/<package-slug>-<hook-file-stem-slug>-<event-slug>-<n>.json` | one file per hook action |
| opencode | – not supported – | silently skipped |

APM parses the source into vendor-neutral hook intent, then each target integrator renders its native schema. Flat command entries become Claude’s required `{ "matcher": "*", "hooks": [...] }` entries in `.claude/settings.json`. Kiro receives its current v1 standalone schema: `{ "version": "v1", "hooks": [{ "name", "trigger", "matcher", "action" }] }`. Kiro trigger names are PascalCase and command timeouts remain in seconds.

Copilot hook files are namespaced with the source package name to avoid collisions across installed deps; bundled scripts land alongside under `.github/hooks/scripts/<pkg>/`.

Merged hook files contain only each target’s native upstream fields. APM writes ownership metadata to a sibling `apm-hooks.json` sidecar for Claude, Cursor, Gemini, Codex, Windsurf, and Antigravity. The sidecar is created and cleaned up automatically alongside the native config; it is an APM implementation detail and should not be edited by hand. When a target is dropped from `targets:` in `apm.yml`, the next `apm install`, `apm compile`, or `apm update` also removes that target’s own hook entries and sidecar – see [`apm install`’s target-contraction note](https://microsoft.github.io/apm/reference/cli/install/#notes) for the exact preserve/remove contract.

Verified against `src/apm_cli/integration/targets.py` and `src/apm_cli/integration/hook_integrator.py`.

Slash commands share their source with prompts. There is no `.apm/commands/` directory:

`your-package/+-- .apm/    +-- prompts/        +-- review-pr.prompt.md   # also routes as a slash command`

Frontmatter the command integrator preserves: `description`, `allowed-tools`, `model`, `argument-hint`, `input`. Other keys (for example `author`, `mcp`, `parameters`) are dropped during the transform and surfaced as install-time diagnostics.

`---description: Review the current PR for security regressions.allowed-tools: [Read, Grep]argument-hint: "[pr-number]"input:  - name: pr_number    description: The PR number to review.---Review pull request #$pr_number. Focus on auth and input handling.`

Supported targets and output paths:

| Target | Output | Format |
| --- | --- | --- |
| copilot | – not a command – | ships as a prompt |
| claude | `.claude/commands/<name>.md` | native markdown |
| grok-build | `.grok/commands/<name>.md` | shared command transform |
| cursor | `.cursor/commands/<name>.md` | claude-format subset |
| opencode | `.opencode/commands/<name>.md` | opencode markdown |
| gemini | `.gemini/commands/<name>.toml` | TOML |
| windsurf | `.windsurf/workflows/<name>.md` | called “workflows” |
| codex | – not supported – | silently skipped |

Verified against `src/apm_cli/integration/targets.py` and `src/apm_cli/integration/command_integrator.py`.

## When NOT to use these

[Section titled “When NOT to use these”](https://microsoft.github.io/apm/producer/author-primitives/hooks-and-commands/#when-not-to-use-these)

Reach for a skill, instruction, or prompt first. Use hooks or commands only when the behavior is a runtime callback (hook) or a command-palette entry (command), you accept that consumers on Copilot, Codex, or OpenCode will not get them, and you will own per-target formats. “Run a script before every tool call” fits a hook. “Give the agent a procedure” fits a skill – and reaches every harness.

*   **Hook event names.** Use the documented [session lifecycle aliases](https://microsoft.github.io/apm/producer/author-primitives/hooks-and-commands/#session-lifecycle-event-aliases). Unknown names are preserved. An install warning appears only when an unmapped name starts with a capital letter or starts lowercase and contains a later capital letter, and that casing conflicts with the target convention.
*   **Cursor command frontmatter loss.** Cursor reuses the Claude command transformer today, so any prompt-only metadata is dropped with a diagnostic. Keep Cursor commands to the preserved key set.
*   **Script paths.** Use `${PLUGIN_ROOT}` (or the harness-specific alias) for scripts that ship inside the package, using the quoting forms described above. Plain absolute paths break on consumers’ machines.
*   **Hook script path resolution.**`apm install -g` (user-scope) rewrites `${PLUGIN_ROOT}` and relative `./` references to absolute paths so Claude Code and Copilot CLI can execute scripts regardless of the working directory. Project-scope `apm install` (no `-g`) keeps non-Claude command paths repo-relative. Claude project hooks use `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` (or `$env:CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` for PowerShell) so checked-in settings remain portable while hooks can run from outside the project directory. Either way, if a referenced script is missing at install time the installer emits a warning – in user-scope the unexpanded variable is rewritten to the absolute source path so the hook fails loudly at runtime; in project-scope the variable is left in place so the deployed config never embeds the installer’s machine-local prefix.
*   **Same `.prompt.md` is two primitives.** A single `.apm/prompts/foo.prompt.md` becomes Copilot’s prompt and Claude’s `/foo` command in the same install. Name files with both surfaces in mind.
*   **OpenCode and hooks.** OpenCode has no hooks concept. Do not author a Claude+OpenCode package and assume hooks reach both – they do not. The install log notes the skip.

Once your hooks and commands are in place, run `apm install --dry-run` to preview what each target will receive, then `apm pack` to bundle. See [Compile](https://microsoft.github.io/apm/producer/compile/) and [Pack a bundle](https://microsoft.github.io/apm/producer/pack-a-bundle/).
