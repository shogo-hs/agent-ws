GPT-5.6 Sol’s Ultra mode is the most expensive lever Codex CLI has ever exposed. It spawns cooperative sub-agents inside the model itself, decomposing your task into parallel work streams that communicate mid-flight.[1](https://codex.danielvaughan.com/2026/07/24/codex-cli-ultra-mode-trade-off-reasoning-budgets-subagent-cost-task-routing/#fn:1) OpenAI reports a Terminal-Bench 2.1 lift from 88.8% (base Sol) to 91.9% — a meaningful gain on hard agentic benchmarks.[2](https://codex.danielvaughan.com/2026/07/24/codex-cli-ultra-mode-trade-off-reasoning-budgets-subagent-cost-task-routing/#fn:2) But early adopters are discovering that Ultra’s token multiplier can exhaust a five-hour usage allowance in twenty minutes and burn through a weekly quota in ninety.[3](https://codex.danielvaughan.com/2026/07/24/codex-cli-ultra-mode-trade-off-reasoning-budgets-subagent-cost-task-routing/#fn:3)

The question is not whether Ultra is powerful. It is whether it is powerful _for your task_.

## How Ultra Actually Works

Ultra is not “thinking harder.” It is a fundamentally different execution model. When you enable Ultra, the orchestrator decomposes your prompt into sub-problems, spawns specialised sub-agents to tackle each in parallel, allows them to share intermediate findings, and reassembles the result.[1](https://codex.danielvaughan.com/2026/07/24/codex-cli-ultra-mode-trade-off-reasoning-budgets-subagent-cost-task-routing/#fn:1) This contrasts with `max` reasoning effort, which simply extends single-agent chain-of-thought without spawning anything.

Each sub-agent is a separate model call at Sol’s output pricing of $30 per million tokens.[4](https://codex.danielvaughan.com/2026/07/24/codex-cli-ultra-mode-trade-off-reasoning-budgets-subagent-cost-task-routing/#fn:4) A task that costs $0.65 on base Sol can reach $2.35 with three cooperating sub-agents — a 3.6x multiplier on a modest task.[5](https://codex.danielvaughan.com/2026/07/24/codex-cli-ultra-mode-trade-off-reasoning-budgets-subagent-cost-task-routing/#fn:5) On larger codebases with six to twelve sub-agents, the multiplier climbs to 6–12x, pushing individual sessions to $30–$75.[3](https://codex.danielvaughan.com/2026/07/24/codex-cli-ultra-mode-trade-off-reasoning-budgets-subagent-cost-task-routing/#fn:3)

## The Reasoning Effort Spectrum

Before reaching for Ultra, it helps to understand the full reasoning effort hierarchy available in Codex CLI as of v0.145.0:

| Level | What It Does | Typical Use | Relative Cost |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `none` | No chain-of-thought | Boilerplate, renames | 1x |
| `low` | Minimal reasoning | Simple edits, formatting | 1.5x |
| `medium` | Standard reasoning | General development | 2x |
| `high` | Extended thinking | Bug diagnosis, design | 3x |
| `xhigh` | Deep reasoning | Architecture, complex logic | 5x |
| `max` | Maximum single-agent depth | Hard problems, single-file | 8x |
| **Ultra** | Parallel sub-agents | Multi-file refactors, migrations | **12–20x** |

The `max` reasoning effort is available to all Sol users and frequently produces results comparable to Ultra for tightly coupled problems — without the sub-agent overhead.[6](https://codex.danielvaughan.com/2026/07/24/codex-cli-ultra-mode-trade-off-reasoning-budgets-subagent-cost-task-routing/#fn:6) The critical distinction: `max` extends _depth_ of reasoning; Ultra extends _breadth_ through parallelism.

## When Ultra Helps

Ultra’s sub-agent architecture excels at tasks that are genuinely decomposable into independent parallel chunks. The rule of thumb from the OpenAI documentation: “If you could not split the task across several human contractors working at the same time, the model probably cannot get much value from subagents either.”[1](https://codex.danielvaughan.com/2026/07/24/codex-cli-ultra-mode-trade-off-reasoning-budgets-subagent-cost-task-routing/#fn:1)

**Tasks where Ultra demonstrably outperforms base Sol:**

*   **Large codebase migrations** spanning multiple independent modules — moving from one ORM to another across twenty services, for instance. Each sub-agent handles a service boundary with minimal cross-talk.[6](https://codex.danielvaughan.com/2026/07/24/codex-cli-ultra-mode-trade-off-reasoning-budgets-subagent-cost-task-routing/#fn:6)
*   **Multi-file feature scaffolding** where components are structurally independent — API handler, database migration, test suite, documentation — and can be generated in parallel.[5](https://codex.danielvaughan.com/2026/07/24/codex-cli-ultra-mode-trade-off-reasoning-budgets-subagent-cost-task-routing/#fn:5)
*   **Cross-cutting refactors** with clean task boundaries — renaming a concept across hundreds of files where each file transformation is independent.[2](https://codex.danielvaughan.com/2026/07/24/codex-cli-ultra-mode-trade-off-reasoning-budgets-subagent-cost-task-routing/#fn:2)

In one reported 120-file refactor, base Sol with `max` reasoning averaged eleven turns; the same task on Ultra completed in fewer wall-clock minutes but consumed roughly 2.5x the tokens.[6](https://codex.danielvaughan.com/2026/07/24/codex-cli-ultra-mode-trade-off-reasoning-budgets-subagent-cost-task-routing/#fn:6)

## When Ultra Backfires

The failure modes are predictable once you understand the architecture.

### Tightly Coupled Single-File Edits

If your task involves iterative changes to a single file where each step depends on the previous one, Ultra’s parallelism adds nothing. The orchestrator still decomposes the task, but sub-agents queue sequentially because there is no parallelisable surface. You pay the orchestration overhead — typically 15–20% extra tokens for decomposition and synthesis — for zero speedup.[5](https://codex.danielvaughan.com/2026/07/24/codex-cli-ultra-mode-trade-off-reasoning-budgets-subagent-cost-task-routing/#fn:5)

### Overlapping Edit Conflicts

When task boundaries are not clean, sub-agents can independently modify the same file in conflicting ways. The orchestrator resolves these conflicts, but the reconciliation step adds latency and tokens that would not exist in a sequential approach. In one test, two sub-agents both modified a shared utility file, requiring an additional synthesis pass.[6](https://codex.danielvaughan.com/2026/07/24/codex-cli-ultra-mode-trade-off-reasoning-budgets-subagent-cost-task-routing/#fn:6)

### Simple Tasks with Obvious Solutions

Variable renames, import additions, test scaffolds with clear patterns — these do not benefit from deeper reasoning at any level. Running them through Ultra is the equivalent of assembling a committee to change a light bulb. A developer running Codex Pro’s 5x tier (75–400 messages per five-hour window) might complete 75–400 standard tasks or 5–10 Ultra tasks before hitting the rate limit.[3](https://codex.danielvaughan.com/2026/07/24/codex-cli-ultra-mode-trade-off-reasoning-budgets-subagent-cost-task-routing/#fn:3)

### The Honeymoon Problem

Experienced users on Reddit report a “honeymoon then nerf” pattern: initial Ultra results feel dramatically better, but as the novelty of parallel execution fades, the cost-quality ratio settles closer to what `max` reasoning effort delivers for most everyday tasks.[5](https://codex.danielvaughan.com/2026/07/24/codex-cli-ultra-mode-trade-off-reasoning-budgets-subagent-cost-task-routing/#fn:5)

## Configuring Reasoning Effort in Codex CLI

The key configuration surfaces for managing reasoning cost:

### Named Profiles for Task Routing

```
# ~/.codex/config.toml

# Default: balanced everyday work
model = "gpt-5.6-terra"
model_reasoning_effort = "medium"

# Deep review profile
[profiles.deep]
model = "gpt-5.6-sol"
model_reasoning_effort = "xhigh"

# Ultra profile for heavy migrations
[profiles.ultra]
model = "gpt-5.6-sol"
model_reasoning_effort = "max"
# Ultra mode access requires preview enrollment
```

Switch profiles per task:

```
# Standard work
codex "add input validation to the signup form"

# Deep reasoning for a tricky bug
codex -p deep "diagnose why the payment webhook intermittently drops events"

# Heavy migration — only when genuinely needed
codex -p ultra "migrate all database queries from SQLAlchemy to Tortoise ORM"
```

### Rollout Token Budgets

The rollout token budget, introduced in v0.142.0 via PRs #28746 and #28494, provides a hard ceiling on total token consumption across all agent threads in a session.[7](https://codex.danielvaughan.com/2026/07/24/codex-cli-ultra-mode-trade-off-reasoning-budgets-subagent-cost-task-routing/#fn:7) This is your primary cost-control lever when experimenting with higher reasoning efforts:

```
[features.rollout_budget]
enabled = true
limit_tokens = 500000          # 500K token ceiling
reminder_interval_tokens = 100000  # warn every 100K
```

When the budget is exhausted, Codex soft-stops the goal rather than silently burning through your quota.[7](https://codex.danielvaughan.com/2026/07/24/codex-cli-ultra-mode-trade-off-reasoning-budgets-subagent-cost-task-routing/#fn:7) For Ultra experimentation, a conservative budget prevents a single runaway session from consuming disproportionate resources.

### In-Session Adjustment

During an active session, use the keyboard shortcuts `Alt+,` and `Alt+.` to lower or raise reasoning effort without restarting.[8](https://codex.danielvaughan.com/2026/07/24/codex-cli-ultra-mode-trade-off-reasoning-budgets-subagent-cost-task-routing/#fn:8) This lets you start a task at `medium`, escalate to `high` when you hit a complex section, and drop back down for straightforward follow-up work.

## A Decision Framework

flowchart TD A[New Task] --> B{Can the task be<br/>split into independent<br/>parallel chunks?} B -- No --> C{Is the problem<br/>genuinely hard?} B -- Yes --> D{Are the chunks<br/>cleanly separable<br/>with no shared files?} C -- No --> E["Use medium or high<br/>(Terra or Luna)"] C -- Yes --> F["Use max effort<br/>(Sol, single agent)"] D -- No --> F D -- Yes --> G{Is the cost justified<br/>by wall-clock savings?} G -- No --> F G -- Yes --> H["Use Ultra<br/>(Sol, sub-agents)"]

The framework reduces to three questions:

1.   **Is it parallelisable?** If not, Ultra adds overhead without benefit.
2.   **Are the boundaries clean?** If sub-agents will fight over shared files, `max` reasoning on a single agent is cheaper and more reliable.
3.   **Is the time saving worth the token cost?** Ultra can be 2–4x faster in wall-clock time but 6–12x more expensive in tokens. For a team running agents at scale, that arithmetic matters.

## The Pricing Reality

At Sol’s $5/$30 per million tokens (input/output), the cost differences are stark:[4](https://codex.danielvaughan.com/2026/07/24/codex-cli-ultra-mode-trade-off-reasoning-budgets-subagent-cost-task-routing/#fn:4)

| Scenario | Reasoning Level | Typical Tokens | Estimated Cost |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Variable rename across 5 files | `low` | 15,000 | $0.05 |
| Feature implementation, single module | `high` | 80,000 | $0.45 |
| Complex bug diagnosis | `max` | 200,000 | $1.20 |
| 20-file migration | Ultra | 900,000 | $5.50 |
| Large codebase refactor | Ultra | 1,800,000 | $12.00 |

A developer using Ultra extensively can reach $150–$375 per day.[3](https://codex.danielvaughan.com/2026/07/24/codex-cli-ultra-mode-trade-off-reasoning-budgets-subagent-cost-task-routing/#fn:3) The same developer using `max` reasoning selectively and dropping to Terra for routine work might spend $20–$40. The difference compounds across a team.

## Practical Recommendations

**Route by difficulty, not by leaderboard.** The 91.9% Terminal-Bench score is impressive but irrelevant if your task is not in the hard tail of that benchmark. Most everyday development work — the vast majority of what senior developers do — falls well within what `high` or `xhigh` reasoning on base Sol or Terra handles competently.[5](https://codex.danielvaughan.com/2026/07/24/codex-cli-ultra-mode-trade-off-reasoning-budgets-subagent-cost-task-routing/#fn:5)

**Start with `max` before reaching for Ultra.** Base Sol with `max` reasoning effort averaged 11 turns versus 18 for GPT-5.5 on the same 10-file refactor — a 39% reduction in turns without the sub-agent multiplier.[6](https://codex.danielvaughan.com/2026/07/24/codex-cli-ultra-mode-trade-off-reasoning-budgets-subagent-cost-task-routing/#fn:6) That is often enough.

**Set rollout budgets before experimenting.** A 500K token budget lets you explore Ultra’s capabilities on a real task without risking a runaway session. Adjust upward once you understand your task’s token profile.

**Audit PreToolUse hooks.** GPT-5.6 Sol fires severity-level-3 actions (file writes, shell execution, API calls) significantly more frequently than GPT-5.5 — one migration showed hook firing rates jumping from 10% of sessions to 70% for identical tasks.[6](https://codex.danielvaughan.com/2026/07/24/codex-cli-ultra-mode-trade-off-reasoning-budgets-subagent-cost-task-routing/#fn:6) Your existing hook configuration may need updating before Sol or Ultra deployment.

**Pin model strings in CI.** OpenAI has form for silent model rollouts — GPT-5.6 appeared in some users’ system prompts before the official 26 June announcement.[6](https://codex.danielvaughan.com/2026/07/24/codex-cli-ultra-mode-trade-off-reasoning-budgets-subagent-cost-task-routing/#fn:6) Add model-identity assertions to any automated pipeline to catch unexpected changes in output behaviour, token costs, or hook firing rates.

## What Comes Next

Ultra is currently in closed preview, restricted to approximately twenty government-approved partner organisations.[1](https://codex.danielvaughan.com/2026/07/24/codex-cli-ultra-mode-trade-off-reasoning-budgets-subagent-cost-task-routing/#fn:1) General availability across ChatGPT, Codex, and the API is promised “in the coming weeks” — though OpenAI has not committed to a specific date.[2](https://codex.danielvaughan.com/2026/07/24/codex-cli-ultra-mode-trade-off-reasoning-budgets-subagent-cost-task-routing/#fn:2) When it lands broadly, expect the token economics to shift as prompt caching, batch pricing, and competitive pressure from Anthropic’s Claude Mythos 5 (84.3% on Terminal-Bench 2.1) and Google’s Gemini models apply downward pressure on per-token costs.[4](https://codex.danielvaughan.com/2026/07/24/codex-cli-ultra-mode-trade-off-reasoning-budgets-subagent-cost-task-routing/#fn:4)

The underlying lesson is not specific to Ultra. Every reasoning escalation — from `medium` to `high` to `max` to Ultra — is a trade-off between quality, speed, and cost. The developers who will get the most from these tools are the ones who match the reasoning budget to the task, not the ones who run everything at maximum.
