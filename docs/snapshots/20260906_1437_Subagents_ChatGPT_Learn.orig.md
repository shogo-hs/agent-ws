ChatGPT Work and Codex can run subagent workflows by spawning specialized agents in parallel and then collecting their results in one response. This can be particularly helpful for complex tasks that are highly parallel, such as codebase exploration or implementing a multi-step feature plan.

In local Codex clients, you can also define custom agents with different model configurations and instructions for different tasks.

[](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/agent-configuration/subagents)
Current Codex releases enable subagent workflows by default. Subagent activity appears in the ChatGPT desktop app, Codex CLI, and the IDE extension.

Because each subagent does its own model and tool work, subagent workflows consume more tokens than comparable single-agent runs.

Ask Codex in an app chat to delegate independent parts of the work to subagents. Current local Codex releases delegate when you ask directly or when applicable `AGENTS.md` or skill instructions request it. The app surfaces each subagent thread so you can inspect its work and the summary returned to the main chat.

Even with large context windows, models have limits. If you flood the main chat (where you're defining requirements, constraints, and decisions) with noisy intermediate output such as exploration notes, test logs, stack traces, and command output, the session can become less reliable over time.

This is often described as:

*   **Context pollution**: useful information gets buried under noisy intermediate output.
*   **Context rot**: performance degrades as the chat fills up with less relevant details.

For background, see the Chroma writeup on [context rot](https://research.trychroma.com/context-rot).

Subagent workflows help by moving noisy work off the main thread:

*   Keep the **main agent** focused on requirements, decisions, and final outputs.
*   Run specialized **subagents** in parallel for exploration, tests, or log analysis.
*   Return **summaries** from subagents instead of raw intermediate output.

They can also save time when the work can run independently in parallel, and they make larger-shaped tasks more tractable by breaking them into bounded pieces. For example, Codex can split analysis of a multi-million-token document into smaller problems and return distilled takeaways to the main thread.

As a starting point, use parallel agents for read-heavy tasks such as exploration, tests, triage, and summarization. Be more careful with parallel write-heavy workflows, because agents editing code at once can create conflicts and increase coordination overhead.

Codex uses a few related terms in subagent workflows:

*   **Subagent workflow**: A workflow where Codex runs parallel agents and combines their results.
*   **Subagent**: A delegated agent that Codex starts to handle a specific task.
*   **Agent thread**: The thread where a subagent does its work. Supported clients let you open these threads to inspect progress or results.

Ask for subagents or parallel agent work directly. Codex can also delegate when applicable project or skill instructions request it.

In practice, manual triggering means using direct instructions such as "spawn two agents," "delegate this work in parallel," or "use one agent per point." Subagent workflows consume more tokens than comparable single-agent runs because each subagent does its own model and tool work.

A good subagent prompt should explain how to divide the work, whether Codex should wait for all agents before continuing, and what summary or output to return.

`Review this branch with parallel subagents. Spawn one subagent for security risks, one for test gaps, and one for maintainability. Wait for all three, then summarize the findings by category with file references.`
Different agents need different model and reasoning settings.

If you don't configure a subagent model or `model_reasoning_effort`, the subagent inherits the parent agent's model and reasoning effort. If an explicit spawn request or an `[agents]` default selects a model without an explicit or configured reasoning effort, the subagent uses that model's default reasoning effort. To balance intelligence, speed, and price for each task, request a specific model or reasoning effort in your prompt, configure `[agents]` defaults in `config.toml`, or set `model` and `model_reasoning_effort` directly in the custom agent file. For example, use `gpt-5.6-terra` for fast scans or a higher-effort `gpt-5.6` configuration for more demanding reasoning.

For most tasks in Codex, start with `gpt-5.6`. Use `gpt-5.6-terra` when you want a faster, lower-cost option for lighter subagent work.

*   **`gpt-5.6`**: Start here for demanding agents. It's strongest for ambiguous, multi-step work that needs planning, tool use, validation, and follow-through across a larger context.
*   **`gpt-5.6-terra`**: Use for agents that favor speed and efficiency over depth, such as exploration, read-heavy scans, large-file review, or processing supporting documents. It works well for parallel workers that return distilled results to the main agent.
*   **`gpt-5.6-luna`**: Use for fast, narrowly scoped agents handling clear, repeatable, or high-volume work.

*   **`ultra`**: Use for the deepest reasoning when the selected model supports it.
*   **`max`** and **`xhigh`**: Use for especially demanding reasoning when the selected model supports these levels.
*   **`high`**: Use when an agent needs to trace complex logic, check assumptions, or work through edge cases (for example, reviewer or security-focused agents).
*   **`medium`**: A balanced default for most agents.
*   **`low`**: Use when the task is straightforward and speed matters most.

Higher reasoning effort increases response time and token usage, but it can improve quality for complex work. For details, see [Models](https://learn.chatgpt.com/codex/models), [Config basics](https://learn.chatgpt.com/codex/config-file/config-basic), and [Configuration Reference](https://learn.chatgpt.com/codex/config-file/config-reference).

ChatGPT or Codex handles orchestration across agents, including spawning new subagents, routing follow-up instructions, waiting for results, and closing agent threads.

When many agents are running, Codex waits until all requested results are available, then returns a consolidated response.

Current local Codex releases spawn agents after a direct request or applicable project or skill instruction.

To see it in action, try the following prompt on your project:

```
I would like to review the following points on the current PR (this branch vs main). Spawn one agent per point, wait for all of them, and summarize the result for each point.
1. Security issue
2. Code quality
3. Bugs
4. Race
5. Test flakiness
6. Maintainability of the code
```

*   Open a subagent thread from the activity shown in the main thread to inspect its work.
*   Ask Codex directly to steer a running subagent, stop it, or close completed subagent threads.

Subagents inherit your current sandbox policy.

Subagents inherit the permission mode selected beneath the composer. Choose the permission mode for the parent turn before you ask Codex to delegate work.

You can also override the sandbox configuration for individual [custom agents](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/agent-configuration/subagents#custom-agents), such as explicitly marking one to work in read-only mode.

Codex ships with built-in agents:

*   `default`: general-purpose fallback agent.
*   `worker`: execution-focused agent for implementation and fixes.
*   `explorer`: read-heavy codebase exploration agent.

To define your own custom agents, add standalone TOML files under `~/.codex/agents/` for personal agents or `.codex/agents/` for project-scoped agents.

Each file defines one custom agent. Codex loads these files as configuration layers for spawned sessions, so custom agents can override the same settings as a normal Codex session config. That can feel heavier than a dedicated agent manifest, and the format may evolve as authoring and sharing mature.

Every standalone custom agent file must define:

*   `name`
*   `description`
*   `developer_instructions`

If a custom agent file sets `model` or `model_reasoning_effort`, the value in the file takes precedence. Before applying the file, Codex resolves each setting from an explicit spawn value, then the corresponding `[agents]` default, then the parent's value. If an explicit spawn request or an `[agents]` default selects a model and neither supplies a reasoning effort, Codex uses that model's default effort. A custom agent file that sets only `model` preserves this previously resolved effort. Set `model_reasoning_effort` in the file too if the selected model doesn't support that effort or you want a different one. Other session settings, such as `sandbox_mode`, `mcp_servers`, and `skills.config`, inherit from the parent when the custom agent file omits them.

Global subagent settings still live under `[agents]` in your [configuration](https://learn.chatgpt.com/codex/config-file/config-basic#configuration-precedence).

| Field | Type | Required | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `agents.enabled` | boolean | No | Enable or disable multi-agent tools. |
| `agents.max_concurrent_threads_per_session` | number | No | Cap concurrently open spawned-agent threads, excluding the primary. |
| `agents.default_subagent_model` | string | No | Set the default model for spawned agents. |
| `agents.default_subagent_reasoning_effort` | string | No | Set the default reasoning effort for spawned agents. |
| `agents.interrupt_message` | boolean | No | Record a model-visible message when an agent turn is interrupted. |

**Notes:**

*   `agents.enabled` defaults to `true`. Set it to `false` to disable multi-agent tools.
*   When you leave `agents.max_concurrent_threads_per_session` unset, Codex chooses the default. Existing configurations can keep using `agents.max_threads` as a legacy alias.
*   Explicit spawn values override `agents.default_subagent_model` and `agents.default_subagent_reasoning_effort`.
*   `agents.interrupt_message` defaults to `true`. Set it to `false` to omit the model-visible interruption message from the agent's context.
*   If a custom agent name matches a built-in agent such as `explorer`, your custom agent takes precedence.

| Field | Type | Required | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | string | Yes | Agent name Codex uses when spawning or referring to this agent. |
| `description` | string | Yes | Human-facing guidance for when Codex should use this agent. |
| `developer_instructions` | string | Yes | Core instructions that define the agent's behavior. |

You can also include other supported `config.toml` keys in a custom agent file, such as `model`, `model_reasoning_effort`, `sandbox_mode`, `mcp_servers`, and `skills.config`.

Codex identifies the custom agent by its `name` field. Matching the filename to the agent name is the simplest convention, but the `name` field is the source of truth.

The best custom agents are narrow and opinionated. Give each one clear job, a tool surface that matches that job, and instructions that keep it from drifting into adjacent work.

This pattern splits review across three focused custom agents:

*   `pr_explorer` maps the codebase and gathers evidence.
*   `reviewer` looks for correctness, security, and test risks.
*   `docs_researcher` checks framework or API documentation through a dedicated MCP server.

Project config (`.codex/config.toml`):

```
[agents]
max_concurrent_threads_per_session = 8
```

`.codex/agents/pr-explorer.toml`:

```
name = "pr_explorer"
description = "Read-only codebase explorer for gathering evidence before changes are proposed."
model = "gpt-5.3-codex-spark"
model_reasoning_effort = "medium"
sandbox_mode = "read-only"
developer_instructions = """
Stay in exploration mode.
Trace the real execution path, cite files and symbols, and avoid proposing fixes unless the parent agent asks for them.
Prefer fast search and targeted file reads over broad scans.
"""
```

`.codex/agents/reviewer.toml`:

```
name = "reviewer"
description = "PR reviewer focused on correctness, security, and missing tests."
model = "gpt-5.6-terra"
model_reasoning_effort = "high"
sandbox_mode = "read-only"
developer_instructions = """
Review code like an owner.
Prioritize correctness, security, behavior regressions, and missing test coverage.
Lead with concrete findings, include reproduction steps when possible, and avoid style-only comments unless they hide a real bug.
"""
```

`.codex/agents/docs-researcher.toml`:

```
name = "docs_researcher"
description = "Documentation specialist that uses the docs MCP server to verify APIs and framework behavior."
model = "gpt-5.6-luna"
model_reasoning_effort = "medium"
sandbox_mode = "read-only"
developer_instructions = """
Use the docs MCP server to confirm APIs, options, and version-specific behavior.
Return concise answers with links or exact references when available.
Do not make code changes.
"""

[mcp_servers.openaiDeveloperDocs]
url = "https://developers.openai.com/mcp"
```

This setup works well for prompts like:

`Review this branch against main. Have pr_explorer map the affected code paths, reviewer find real risks, and docs_researcher verify the framework APIs that the patch relies on.`
This pattern is useful for UI regressions, flaky browser flows, or integration bugs that cross application code and the running product.

Project config (`.codex/config.toml`):

```
[agents]
max_concurrent_threads_per_session = 6
```

`.codex/agents/code-mapper.toml`:

```
name = "code_mapper"
description = "Read-only codebase explorer for locating the relevant frontend and backend code paths."
model = "gpt-5.6-luna"
model_reasoning_effort = "medium"
sandbox_mode = "read-only"
developer_instructions = """
Map the code that owns the failing UI flow.
Identify entry points, state transitions, and likely files before the worker starts editing.
"""
```

`.codex/agents/browser-debugger.toml`:

```
name = "browser_debugger"
description = "UI debugger that uses browser tooling to reproduce issues and capture evidence."
model = "gpt-5.6-terra"
model_reasoning_effort = "high"
sandbox_mode = "workspace-write"
developer_instructions = """
Reproduce the issue in the browser, capture exact steps, and report what the UI actually does.
Use browser tooling for screenshots, console output, and network evidence.
Do not edit application code.
"""

[mcp_servers.chrome_devtools]
url = "http://localhost:3000/mcp"
startup_timeout_sec = 20
```

`.codex/agents/ui-fixer.toml`:

```
name = "ui_fixer"
description = "Implementation-focused agent for small, targeted fixes after the issue is understood."
model = "gpt-5.3-codex-spark"
model_reasoning_effort = "medium"
developer_instructions = """
Own the fix once the issue is reproduced.
Make the smallest defensible change, keep unrelated files untouched, and validate only the behavior you changed.
"""

[[skills.config]]
path = "/Users/me/.agents/skills/docs-editor/SKILL.md"
enabled = false
```

This setup works well for prompts like:

`Investigate why the settings modal fails to save. Have browser_debugger reproduce it, code_mapper trace the responsible code path, and ui_fixer implement the smallest fix once the failure mode is clear.`
