Abstract

Despite their impressive performance on complex tasks, current language models (LMs) typically operate in a vacuum: Each input query is processed separately, without retaining insights from previous attempts. Here, we present Dynamic Cheatsheet (DC), a lightweight framework that endows a black-box LM with a persistent, evolving memory. Rather than repeatedly re-discovering or re-committing the same solutions and mistakes, DC enables models to store and reuse accumulated strategies, code snippets, and general problem-solving insights at inference time. This test-time learning enhances performance substantially across a range of tasks without needing explicit ground-truth labels or human feedback. Leveraging DC, Claude 3.5 Sonnet’s accuracy more than doubled on AIME math exams once it began retaining algebraic insights across questions. Similarly, GPT-4o’s success rate on the Game of 24 puzzle increased from about 10% to 99% after the model discovered and reused a Python-based solution. In tasks prone to arithmetic mistakes, such as balancing equations, DC enabled GPT-4o and Claude to reach near-perfect accuracy by recalling previously validated code, whereas their baselines stagnated around 50%. Beyond arithmetic challenges, DC yields notable accuracy gains on knowledge-demanding tasks. Claude achieved a 9% improvement in GPQA-Diamond and an 8% boost on MMLU-Pro Engineering and Physics problems. Crucially, DC’s memory is self-curated, focusing on concise, transferable snippets rather than entire transcripts, thereby facilitating meta-learning and avoiding context ballooning. Unlike fine-tuning or static retrieval methods, DC adapts LMs’ problem-solving skills on the fly, without modifying their underlying parameters, and offers a practical approach for continuously refining responses and cutting routine errors. Overall, our findings present DC as a promising approach for augmenting LMs with persistent memory, bridging the divide between isolated inference events and the cumulative, experience-driven learning characteristic of human cognition.**

Baseline represents a standard prompting approach with minimal guidance, while DC-∅\emptyset (a stronger baseline) contains explicit structured instructions for problem solving, as well as for Python code generation and execution, but lacks a memory component. Our proposed DC-Cu and DC-RS variants incorporate an evolving, text-based memory to enhance inference-time learning. Results (accuracy, %) demonstrate substantial improvements, with Claude 3.5 Sonnet gaining 27% on AIME 2024 and 30% on AIME 2025 under DC-Cu. In Game of 24, GPT-4o leaps from 10% (baseline) to 99% under DC-RS, reflecting its ability to retain and apply Python-based solutions efficiently. Similarly, Claude 3.5 Sonnet’s accuracy more than doubles in Math Equation Solver, reaching 98%. Overall, these findings highlight the impact of test-time learning through controlled memory augmentation and efficient retrieval.

1 Introduction

Modern large language models (LLMs) can tackle complex reasoning tasks, answer various questions, and generate extensive texts. Yet they still suffer from one critical limitation: once deployed, these models are fixed prior to deployment and typically retain no explicit or implicit memory of past questions, successes, or mistakes during inference. They approach each new problem de novo, often re-deriving the same insights—and re-committing the same errors. In contrast, human cognition stands on a foundation of incremental learning, continuously internalizing new experiences and solutions into a persistent mental model.

In this work, we present Dynamic Cheatsheet (DC), a simple and intuitive framework that endows black-box LLMs with a persistent, evolving memory at inference time. Rather than fine-tuning weights (for instance, through dynamic evaluation (Krause et al., 2019) or domain adaptation (Gururangan et al., 2020)) or retrieving facts from a massive static corpus (as in traditional retrieval-augmented generation systems (Guu et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2024b)), DC dynamically curates a compact library of reusable strategies, solution sketches, and code snippets. Either before or after each query, DC enables the system to decide which lessons to store, what to discard, and how to refine existing entries—thus effectively “learning” from successes and failures. It is a flexible online-learning approach that enables a black-box LLM to improve itself without needing any explicit ground truth labels or human feedback.

The overall workflow of DC is intuitive and compelling. In one version of DC (DC-Cu.), when presented with a new query, the LM first consults its external memory to see if any prior insights, strategies or relevant model solutions have been stored. It then proposes a solution by combining the retrieved insights with its own internal reasoning capabilities. Upon generating an answer, it then proceeds to a curation phase that updates the memory: If the approach seems to be correct, useful, or practical, DC codifies it in its memory for future use; if an error surfaces, DC may revise or prune faulty heuristics. This all happens without gradient-based parameter updates, so computational overhead remains modest, and compatibility with black-box APIs (e.g., GPT-4 or Claude) is fully preserved. See Figure 4.

We tested DC across multiple challenging benchmarks and observed that it increases performance and reduces repetitive mistakes. On AIME 2024, Claude 3.5 Sonnet jumped from 23% to 50% accuracy, more than doubling its baseline score, by retaining algebraic and combinatorial insights. Likewise, it gained 30% accuracy on AIME 2025. Notably, these improvements hold in knowledge-intensive tasks as well. On GPQA-Diamond, which tests specialized domain questions, DC lifted Claude by over 9%. In MMLU-Pro Engineering and Physics, it provided up to an 8% boost in performance by allowing the model to maintain a “toolkit” of formulas and general problem-solving patterns.

Figure 2: 
Overall task performance of Claude 3.5 Sonnet under the baseline prompting approach with minimal instructions (BL) and Dynamic Cheatsheet with Retrieval & Synthesis (DC-RS). 

An even more striking and compelling example is the Game of 24, a puzzle that requires the solver to combine four digits into an arithmetic expression equaling 24. GPT-4o’s baseline performance (10%) increased to 99% under DC. Early in the test sequence, the model discovered that an efficient Python brute-force solver eliminated all manual guesswork. Once this snippet was stored, GPT-4o simply retrieved it for subsequent queries, avoiding manual arithmetic entirely. We saw a similar pattern in Math Equation Balancer, where GPT-4o and Claude soared from 45-50% to 98–100% by “recalling” a straightforward code-based approach instead of manually fumbling with numeric manipulations.

Nonetheless, DC is not a panacea. We found that smaller models, such as GPT-4o-mini, benefit from DC in limited amounts. These models generate too few correct solutions in these challenging tasks in the first place, leaving the memory populated with flawed or incomplete strategies. Worse, they struggle to refine stored content.
DC can amplify the strengths of models that can already produce high-quality outputs, but not fix foundational gaps in reasoning.

We also note that DC differs from naive “append the entire conversation history” in-context learning approaches. Under DC, memory is carefully curated, focusing on succinct, useful, and transferable knowledge over raw transcripts. This prevents ballooning context lengths (Liu et al., 2024a) and helps ensure that repeated retrieval remains tractable. Indeed, part of DC’s contribution is in formalizing a mechanism for selective, evolving retention—storing just enough to solve the next set of tasks without drowning in an ever-growing text buffer.

Figure 3: Algorithmic illustration of the Dynamic Cheatsheet (DC)-based approaches and other baseline methods. Here, Gen represents the solution generator model, Cur the memory curator, and Retr the retriever. While we use the same black-box LLMs for both generation and curation, we differentiate their roles via task-agnostic instructions (prompts). The retrieval mechanism ranks historical inputs based on cosine similarity with the current query, selecting the most relevant past examples along with their generated solutions.

2 Dynamic Cheatsheet (DC) Methodology

DC, in its core, includes an external, non-parametric memory that evolves in tandem with the LLM’s inference process. Rather than fine-tuning the underlying weights, DC tracks successes and failures of the model at test time, then selectively stores heuristics, strategies, or short textual artifacts that can guide the LLM in future instances. Notably, this approach respects the black-box nature of many commercial LLM APIs: no gradient-based updates are required, and the model’s core parameters remain untouched.

2.1 DC: Building Blocks and Iterative Loop

The DC framework consists of two core modules: generation and curation. Both modules can easily operate on top of the same LM (prompted differently) or on separate LMs.

2.1.1 Solution Generation with Memory

Let’s consider a sequence of inputs (x1,x2,…,xn)(x_{1},x_{2},\dots,x_{n}), where each xi∼𝒟testx_{i}\sim\mathcal{D}_{\text{test}} indicates a new query or problem posed to the model sampled from the same distribution 𝒟test\mathcal{D}_{\text{test}} (a typical setting in online learning). The distribution 𝒟test\mathcal{D}_{\text{test}} is unknown to us. At the ii-th step, the model is provided with both the new query xix_{i} and the current memory state MiM_{i}, which captures knowledge gleaned from previous successes and failures. We denote the solution generator by Gen:

y~i=Gen​(xi,Mi)\tilde{y}_{i}=\texttt{Gen}(x_{i},M_{i})

(1)

Here, y~i\tilde{y}_{i} is the candidate solution produced by the model. MiM_{i} helps condition the model to reuse or adapt previously stored solutions, insights, techniques, or heuristics.

2.1.2 Memory Curation Step

After the generator produces its answer y~i\tilde{y}_{i} to xix_{i}, the curator, Cur, updates the current content of the memory:

Mi+1=Cur​(Mi,xi,y~i)M_{i+1}=\texttt{Cur}(M_{i},x_{i},\tilde{y}_{i})

(2)

During memory curation, Cur mainly considers: (i) the usefulness and generalizability of the newly produced answer (i.e., if y~i\tilde{y}_{i} is correct or provides valuable and generalizable insights, it is distilled into a form suitable for later reference), (ii) refinement or removal of existing memory entries (i.e., if an existing memory entry was incorrect or superseded by a more efficient or versatile strategy, Cur may remove or update it), and (iii) clarity and compactness of the entire memory (i.e., memory entries are consolidated to retain succinct, high-impact references and heuristics).

Figure 4: 
Illustration of Dynamic Cheatsheet (DC-Cu variant).

Cur does not have access to ground-truth labels; so, it has to assess the correctness and efficiency of the solutions by itself before updating the memory. In our experiments, we instruct a single model to perform this crucial step. Yet, in practice, Cur can be implemented as a series of steps that instruct multiple tools and models, through different prompts, to verify the validity and efficiency of the solution and to transform the raw solution text into even more generalizable, reliable, and efficient strategies, insights, and code snippets.

We refer to this version of DC above as DC-Cu (short for DC-Cumulative). Under DC-Cu, the system first performs solution generation based on the current memory (Eqn. 1) and then updates the memory (Eqn. 2), by cumulatively expanding and refining the memory items thus far. Unlike DC-RS, which is discussed in the next part, DC-Cu, does not contain a retrieval component, however.

2.2 DC with Retrieval & Synthesis (DC-RS)

DC-Cu has two potential drawbacks. First, it updates the memory after processing an input query, rather than refining it before generating a response. This means the model lacks the opportunity to incorporate new insights from the current query while reasoning through its solution. Second, DC-Cu does not store or revisit past input-output pairs unless explicitly retained in memory. This omission prevents the model from directly retrieving and leveraging historical responses, which can be particularly valuable in benchmarks covering diverse topics or domains (e.g., GPQA-Diamond).

To address these issues, DC-RS modifies the sequence of memory updates and introduces a retrieval mechanism, Retr, into the curation process. Retr allows the model to retrieve the most relevant past input-output pairs from its knowledge base. By refining the memory before responding and retrieving prior cases when needed, DC-RS enhances the model’s adaptability and reasoning efficiency.

 2

 We set kk to 3 in all our experiments. (Initially, we considered higher top-kk values such as 5 and 7, but the gain was insignificant.) It then passes these select examples, RiR_{i}, along with the most recent memory content, Mi−1M_{i-1}, to the curator to update the memory, that is to get MiM_{i}. Finally, it uses the generator to produce y~i\tilde{y}_{i}, given xix_{i} and MiM_{i}. We summarize all these steps below:

Ri\displaystyle R_{i}

2.3 Baselines

To quantify the efficacy of memory-driven test-time learning, we compare DC and its variants to four baselines:

(1) Baseline prompting (BL). This plain ‘‘vanilla’’ prompting approach, with minimal instructions, simply prompts the model without any iterative memory or retrieval mechanism. It reflects traditional one-off inference.33
 3

 Please refer to Figure 12 to see the full instruction (prompt) used in BLh. We experimented with the zero-shot CoT approach (Kojima et al., 2022) in our preliminary experiments, but it did not yield any gains (Arcuschin et al., 2025). We, therefore, did not include it as a baseline method in our experiments.

(2) DC-∅\emptyset (empty memory). To isolate the effect of memory curation, this DC baseline always keeps the memory content effectively empty.44
 4

 We adopt the generator prompt template used in DC-RS, namely Figure 13, for DC-∅\emptyset, though we replace the memory placeholder with the text “(empty cheatsheet)”. DC-∅\emptyset allows us to measure how much performance improvement arises purely from storing and reusing knowledge over time. While there is no continuous knowledge storage or strategy reuse, this method follows the instructions in Figure 13 and is therefore a strong baseline.

(3) Full-History Appending (FH). This is a naive approach that appends the entire conversation history to the model input without any curation or truncation.55
 5

 We consider and test this baseline only on AIME 2024 and AIME 2025, which are relatively small in their size (each contains 30 examples) compared to other benchmarks. FH can exceed context-window limits and include redundant or low-value information, but nonetheless, it provides a useful comparison for methods that actively curate content.66
 6

 We use the generator prompt template in Figure 13 again, but include the entire raw input-output pairs from the previous steps in the memory—without any curation, truncation, or synthesis.

(4) Dynamic Retrieval (DR). A final baseline uses retrieval but no curation. Specifically, for each new query, it retrieves the most similar past interactions and directly pastes them, verbatim, into the prompt. DR can help the model see relevant input-output pairs but not directly codify any abstract or generalized solutions.77
 7

 FH is similar to DR, but we include only a select (most relevant) input-output pairs in the memory content.

Figure 3 (above) contains pseudocodes of all the primary methods and baselines considered in this paper.

3 Experimental Setup

3.1 Tasks and Datasets

To rigorously evaluate DC’s effectiveness, we focus on challenging tasks where contemporary state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT-4o and Claude 3.5, still face limitations. Rather than evaluating on benchmarks where performance is near saturation (e.g., BBH (Suzgun et al., 2023b), MGSM (Shi et al., 2023), GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021)), we prioritize tasks that demand multi-step reasoning, heuristic search, strategic adaptation, and cumulative learning---that is, tasks in which iterative memory refinement can yield tangible improvements over time.88
 8

 We release all the original input-output pairs in our codebase: http://github.com/suzgunmirac/dynamic-cheatsheet.

Overall, the selected datasets include algorithmic, logical, and domain-specific reasoning tasks, each chosen to stress-test the model’s ability to refine its reasoning over time.

(a) AIME 2020–2025 Exam Questions: The American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME) is a prestigious high-school competition featuring complex problems across algebra, combinatorics, number theory, geometry, and probability. These questions require deep mathematical reasoning and multi-step problem-solving. We consider three subsets: AIME 202499

 huggingface.co/datasets/yentinglin/aime_2025. (30 questions), and AIME 2020–20241111
 11

 huggingface.co/datasets/di-zhang-fdu/AIME_1983_2024. (133 questions).

(b) GPQA-Diamond (Rein et al., 2024): A high-quality, difficult subset of the Graduate-Level Google-Proof Q&A (GPQA) benchmark, GPQA-Diamond contains 198 expert-validated questions across natural sciences, including biology, chemistry, and physics. These questions were correctly answered by domain experts but often missed by non-experts, making them ideal for evaluating DC’s ability to handle complex, multi-hop reasoning tasks.

(c) Game of 24 (Yao et al., 2023; Suzgun & Kalai, 2024): A heuristic-driven arithmetic challenge where the objective is to form an expression that evaluates to 24 using four given numbers exactly once. For instance, if the input values were “7 7 8 11,” one valid answer would be “8*(7+7-11).” This task emphasizes systematic search, strategic reasoning, and pattern recognition. We use the 100 examples from (Suzgun & Kalai, 2024) to assess DC’s capacity for refining computational heuristics and strategy over manual attempts.

(d) Math Equation Balancer: Focused on elementary arithmetic reasoning, this dataset requires the model to complete equations by inserting the appropriate operators to form valid expressions. The task emphasizes the sequential placement of operators, as illustrated by the example “1 ? 2 ? 3 = 6,” where the model must identify the correct operators to satisfy the equation (“1 + 2 + 3 = 6” or “1 * 2 * 3 = 6”). We compiled 250 arithmetic expressions for this task.

(e) MMLU-Pro (Engineering and Physics) (Wang et al., 2024b): A professional-level subset of the MMLU benchmark focused on physics and engineering. All questions are presented in a multiple-choice form. The original dataset contains 1,299 physics and 969 engineering questions. We sampled 250 questions from each subset.

3.2 Language Models

We evaluate the efficacy of DC across a range of language models. Our selection includes both state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet and their smaller-scale counterparts (namely, GPT-4o-mini and Claude 3.5 Haiku), as well as models such as DeepSeek R1 that are designed specifically for reasoning-intensive tasks.

3.3 Evaluation Protocol

To ensure standardized and reliable evaluation, all models are instructed to format their final answers in a structured, machine-readable format. All model answers are expected to be wrapped in the following XML-style tags:

⬇

 <answer>

 (final answer)

 </answer>

This explicit format ensures accurate and consistent parsing, eliminating errors arising from extraneous text or ambiguous outputs. Once extracted, the final answers are evaluated using their corresponding task-specific accuracy metric.

3.3.1 Accuracy Metrics

Given the diversity of the tasks, we use different accuracy metrics tailored to the specific requirements of each dataset.

Soft Match (SM) is a lenient metric that considers an answer correct if it matches the ground truth after ignoring minor formatting differences, such as punctuation or whitespace variations. We apply this metric to GPQA-Diamond, and MMLU Pro (Engineering and Physics), in which questions are presented in a multiple-choice format.

Functionally Correct (FC) is an even more flexible metric that evaluates whether the model’s output satisfies the task-specific constraints, even if the exact numeral presentation or formatting differs slightly from the reference solution. We apply this metric to the Game of 24, Math Equation Balancer, and AIME benchmarks.

Table 1: 
Performance comparison of Dynamic Cheatsheet (DC) variants for Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o across multiple benchmarks. BL (Baseline): standard inference without memory;
DC-∅\emptyset (Empty Memory): includes structured problem-solving and explicit tool-use instructions but no memory retention mechanism; DR (Dynamic Retrieval): uses retrieval but lacks curated memory updates; DC-Cu (Cumulative Memory): iteratively accumulates model solutions but lacks retrieval; and DC-RS (Retrieval & Synthesis): combines retrieval with memory refinement/synthesis. These results highlight substantial accuracy gains under DC: Claude 3.5 Sonnet’s AIME 2024 accuracy jumps by 27% under DC-Cu, and GPT-4o’s Game of 24 accuracy leaps from 10% to 99% under DC-RS.

4 Main Results

4.1 DC enables test-time learning and reduces repetitive errors

One of the most compelling illustrations of DC’s capabilities emerges from the Game of 24 task. As seen in Table 1, GPT-4o’s baseline accuracy on this arithmetic puzzle was just 10%. Under DC-RS, its performance increased to 99%, illustrating DC’s capacity for test-time learning and iterative refinement. Early in the task sequence, GPT-4o discovered a reliable, Python-based brute-force method to solve Game of 24 and later on recognized the repetitive structure of the problem. The model then encoded this approach into its memory. Once established, GPT-4o consistently retrieved and applied the more or less same Python solution for subsequent examples, leading to rapid and accurate results.

The performance under DC-∅\emptyset (19%) further highlights the positive impact of memory curation and retrieval. DC-∅\emptyset uses the same core generator but keeps the memory empty, thus lacking the mechanism to store and reuse solutions. The large gap between 19% (DC-∅\emptyset) and 99% (DC-RS) confirms that effective memory usage, in which past solutions are retrieved and generalized, is the main driver of GPT-4o’s transformation from ad-hoc solver to near-perfect performer in Game of 24.

In contrast, Claude 3.5 Sonnet showed marginal gain, moving from 12% to 14%. Despite DC’s scaffolding, Claude did not internalize a generalized approach but instead continued to rely on manual arithmetic solutions. This underscores that while DC provides the framework for test-time adaptation, its ultimate success hinges on the model’s innate capacity to identify and encode robust, reusable strategies.

Figure 5: 
Excerpt from GPT-4o’s external memory after processing 100 examples from Game of 24 under DC-RS. Early in the test sequence, the model discovered a Python-based brute-force solution, stored it, and subsequently retrieved it for subsequent puzzles. This shift to structured code reuse resulted in a dramatic performance increase from 10% to 99% accuracy, eliminating arithmetic errors and redundant problem-solving efforts.

4.2 DC provides substantial improvements across various challenging reasoning benchmarks

Beyond Game of 24, DC yielded significant gains across a range of complex mathematical and algorithmic tasks. See Table 1. The results below illustrate how iterative solution reuse can helpful in complex reasoning problems.

AIME Exam Problems.
The AIME exams provided some of the most dramatic improvements under DC. For Claude 3.5 Sonnet, performance on AIME 2020–2024 surged from 6.7% to 40.6% under DC-RS. A similar upward trend appeared on AIME 2024 (23.3% to 50.0%) and AIME 2025 (6.7% to 36.7%) under DC-Cu. DC-Cu, where the model curates memory after processing the input and does not involve a retrieval stage, also proved potent in recent exam sets, achieving highest accuracy scores in AIME 2024 and 2025. GPT-4o also showed some noteworthy gains. Its AIME 2024 performance raised from 20.0% to 40.0% under DC-RS, while its AIME 2025 score climbed from 6.7% to 20.0%. These boosts suggests that structured test-time-produced memory can help tackle difficult math problems.

GPQA-Diamond. On GPQA-Diamond, Claude 3.5 Sonnet improved from 59.6% to 68.7% under DC-RS, a robust 9.1% gain purely from test-time adaptation. DR (63.6%) demonstrated that retrieval alone helps, but the further jump to 68.7% highlights how memory curation and synthesis can yield additional benefits. By contrast, GPT-4o experienced only a slight increase from 57.1% to 58.1% with DC-RS; our quantitative analysis of the model’s outputs and memory showed us that retrieval can, in some cases, introduce confusion, especially if suboptimal examples are recalled. This contrast between different models underscores how the success of retrieval-based adaptation partly depends on model-specific generation and curation capabilities.

Math Equation Balancer. As Table 1 shows, the baseline performance for Claude 3.5 Sonnet (44.8%) rose to 98–100% with DC-RS and DC-Cu, while GPT-4o similarly improved from 50.0% to near-perfect accuracy (99–100%). As observed in Game of 24, the models quickly learned an algorithmic or Python-based balancing routine, stored it in external memory, and repeatedly retrieved it, achieving exceptional consistency once the core method was established.

MMLU-Pro Tasks. For MMLU-Pro Eng. and Physics, Claude 3.5 Sonnet exhibited consistent gains, rising by up to 8.0% in Physics (from 74% to 82%). Our examination of the curated memory entries shows that Claude temporarily stored and retrieved compact “reference guides” on engineering and physics principles, which might have proved beneficial for thematically similar questions. GPT-4o, on the other hand, observed slight decreases from the baseline on these tasks, suggesting that domain complexity and baseline knowledge gaps may attenuate DC’s benefits if curated memory is less reliable or consistent.

4.3 Memory curation (DC) fosters generalization and provides gains over full-history-appending (FH)

Whereas FH (full-history) simply appends every previous dialogue turn into the prompt, DC actively filters and synthesizes high-value content. As shown in Table 2, Sonnet under FH reached 26.7% accuracy in 2024 questions, while DC-based methods hit 50.0%. Similarly, GPT-4o managed a baseline of 20.0% but fell to 6.7% using FH, in direct contrast to 40.0% with DC-RS. Excessive uncurated input-output pairs can not only overwhelm the model’s context window, dilute crucial insights and hamper retrieval efficiency, but also significantly increase inference costs over time. On the other hand, DC’s selective memory curation ensures that problem-solving tips or code snippets remain readily accessible without clutter, thus facilitating more robust and consistent improvements across consecutive queries.

FH stores all past queries and outputs, while DC-Cu and DC-RS selectively refine stored memory. Results indicate that targeted memory curation in DC-RS leads to greater accuracy gains compared to full history retention, supporting the need for structured, self-updating knowledge mechanisms.

4.4 DC fosters efficient tool usage / code generation

A successful behavior under DC is the LLMs’ inclination toward code generation to handle computationally intensive tasks. GPT-4o’s near-complete reliance on Python scripts for Game of 24 exemplifies this shift. Rather than performing manual arithmetic repeatedly, GPT-4o recognized that code-based brute force is more systematic. It generated, stored, and iteratively refined a Python function that tested permutations of numbers and operations, allowing it to solve each instance of Game of 24 with high accuracy.

This inclination toward automation illustrates DC’s potential to nurture efficient tool-usage: the capacity to recognize when external tools (e.g., Python, symbolic math engines, or dedicated solvers) are more robust than internally verbalized chain-of-thought calculations. While we restricted the scope of tool usage to Python interpreter in this study, future expansions could easily explore a broader suite of tools, potentially amplifying LLM performance in specialized domains such as computational biology or legal research.

4.5 Model scale and capacity impact DC effectiveness

Figure 7: 
Cumulative performance progression under DC for GPQA-Diamond (left) and Game of 24 (right). In GPQA-Diamond, Claude 3.5 Sonnet steadily improves as it accumulates relevant knowledge snippets (the first few points are noisy because yy measures cumulative accuracy). Meanwhile, in Game of 24, GPT-4o rapidly transitions from trial-and-error arithmetic to near-perfect performance once it recognizes and stores a Python-based solution. These trends highlight DC’s ability to enhance accuracy via iterative test-time learning.

Our current results indicate that the effectiveness of DC is strongly tied to the model’s scale and underlying generative capacity. While Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o showed notable gains across multiple tasks under DC, their smaller counterparts, Claude 3.5 Haiku and GPT-4o-mini, showed more limited and inconsistent gains.

Table 3, for instance, shows that Claude 3.5 Haiku achieved moderate gains under DC, with its accuracy on AIME 2024 rising from 10.0% (baseline) to 36.7% under DC-Cu. But gains on AIME 2025 were weaker, reaching only 13.3% under DC-∅\emptyset and DC-Cu. Interestingly, GPQA-Diamond saw an improvement from 43.4% to 49.0% under DC-RS, suggesting that retrieval-based adaptation might still provide utility in smaller models.

Table 3: Performance of Claude 3.5 Haiku and GPT-4o-mini, the smaller counterparts of Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o, across AIME (2024, 2025) and GPQA-Diamond. These smaller models struggle to fully leverage DC, suggesting that memory-based adaptation is most effective when the base LM has sufficient generative competence. Performance improvements are more muted, highlighting the dependency of DC on model-scale reasoning ability.

That said, GPT-4o-mini (Table 3) showed even smaller gains, with some variants leading to slight declines in performance. On AIME 2024, DC-∅\emptyset provided a 20.0% boost, but both DC-Cu and DC-RS performed worse than baseline. AIME 2025 showed a minor improvement, peaking at 16.7% under DC-RS. On GPQA-Diamond, GPT-4o-mini’s performance, however, remained largely stagnant or slightly declined under memory-based adaptation, suggesting that it struggled to leverage stored information effectively.

These imply two drawbacks of smaller models under DC:

(a) Generative competence. For DC to be effective, the base model must produce correct solutions with sufficient frequency to populate the memory with high-quality, reusable strategies. Smaller models, such as GPT-4o-mini and Claude 3.5 Haiku, generate correct solutions less reliably, leading to a sparse or low-quality memory repository. As a result, iterative refinement stalls because the stored knowledge consists mostly of incorrect or partial attempts.

(b) Contextual and memory curation limitations. Smaller models struggle with long-context understanding/generation and memory retrieval, leading to inefficient or irrelevant memory usage. Unlike their larger counterparts, which can more effectively retrieve and synthesize solutions from stored heuristics, smaller models often fail to retrieve the most relevant past solutions or misapply retrieved knowledge to new problems. This results in inconsistent performance under DC-RS, particularly in tasks requiring complex reasoning or strategic adaptation.

4.6 Test-time task similarity and example ordering can amplify DC’s overall impact

Another central insight is that DC thrives when test examples share structural similarities. In both Game of 24 and Math Equation Balancer, once GPT-4o identified an efficient solution, it reused it consistently for subsequent tasks. Similarly, in AIME, discovering a geometry or combinatorics strategy allowed for easy transfer across questions of analogous structure. Consequently, tasks arranged to present related questions early may accelerate and improve the model’s test-time learning. This suggests that curriculum-style learning (Bengio et al., 2009), where simpler or archetypal problems are presented first to build a repository of valid heuristics, may potentially bootstrap performance. Cf. (Lopez-Paz & Ranzato, 2017; Zelikman et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2024)

5 Additional Analyses and Discussions

Reasoning and information efficiency.
One key insight is that DC reduces the need to “reinvent the wheel” for each query. By encoding and reusing well-established techniques (e.g., Python-based solving for Game of 24), models can bypass repeated rediscovery of the same strategies. This significantly cuts down reasoning overhead and token usage in subsequent queries, though the initial cost of discovering a robust approach and curating it remains non-trivial.

DC performs better than majority voting (MV). To test if DC provides advantages over conventional MV at inference, we also tested Sonnet on AIME 2024 and 2025 using both approaches. MV, which selects the most common answer from three independent generations, yielded no improvements over single-shot inference. As seen in Table 4, on AIME 2024, MV performed identically to the baseline (23.3%), while on AIME 2025, it remained at 6.7%, offering no tangible gain. Even with DC-∅\emptyset, MV slightly underperformed (33.3% vs. 36.7%). In contrast, DC-Cu outperformed MV, reaching 50.0% on AIME 2024 and 36.7% on AIME 2025. Unlike MV, which passively aggregates outputs, DC actively refines knowledge over time, eliminating errors and improving solution quality. This confirms that memory-based adaptation is far more effective than simple statistical voting in complex reasoning tasks.

Clustering of errors and corrections.
Our experiments suggest that errors and their corrections often cluster in a latent embedding space. See Figure 10. Once a model acquires a high-quality heuristic for a cluster of related queries, it can apply this knowledge to tightly embedded neighbors. However, faulty heuristics that slip into memory can be equally amplified. Ensuring that the memory remains “clean” thus requires careful curation and, if necessary, pruning to avoid propagating erroneous strategies.

Transferability of memory content across models.
We also observed that larger models, such as Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o, can sometimes produce higher-quality strategies that, in principle, could benefit smaller models if the memory is transferred. However, if a smaller model lacks the generative capacity to interpret or refine those strategies correctly, its performance can stall or degrade. In our ablation experiments, we observed mixed results. This indicates that memory entries, while helpful, cannot fully compensate for inadequate base capability.

Long-context generation versus understanding.
Most large LLMs excel at processing lengthy inputs but struggle to generate comparably long1212
 12

 See, e.g., (Liu et al., 2024b). and well-organized outputs. DC’s memory curation after each query can demand precise reproduction or modification of prior knowledge. We observed instances where the model merely references or abbreviates the existing memory (e.g., “Previous content […] preserved”) instead of explicitly rewriting it. Such truncated memory updates can reduce the quality of stored heuristics over time. Potential solutions include maintaining a structured, external database that the LM can reference without regenerating large swaths of text each time.

Retrieval bottlenecks and noise.
While retrieval-based variants (e.g., DC-RS) can substantially improve accuracy, poorly filtered retrieval mechanisms can introduce confusion, particularly when presented with highly diverse or loosely related queries. For example, in our experiments, GPT-4o’s performance occasionally dipped in GPQA-Diamond due to suboptimal retrieval choices. This underscores the importance of robust retrieval methods (e.g., dense vector search, advanced ranking algorithms) that can reliably surface higher quality exemplars or heuristics while suppressing irrelevant or contradictory texts.

Hierarchical and modular memory.
As LLM deployments scale, specialized domains may benefit from subdividing or hierarchically organizing memory. For instance, a system could maintain separate curated memories for topics like combinatorics or physics, each updated by a specialized retrieval or curation mechanism. This may reduce the load on a unified memory store and help isolate errors within their respective domains, with the goal of further improving the clarity and reliability of retrieved heuristics.

Time and token complexity.
Although DC requires memory curation after each query, it optimizes efficiency over time by reducing redundant computation and token usage.1313
 13

 On AIME 2024, Claude Sonnet averaged 370 tokens under BL, 494 under DC-∅\emptyset, 1035 under DC-RS, and 1831 under DC-Cu. As the model retrieves and refines solutions, memory maintenance becomes a net gain rather than a cost. However, its sequential structure still poses challenges for large-scale parallel or batch tasks requiring independent inference.

Smaller or more specialized models and R1 experiments.
Finally, we note that smaller models, such as GPT-4o-mini, show limited gains under DC, as seen in Table 3. Additional experiments with “R1” models such as DeepSeek R1 and o1 similarly showed minimal or inconsistent improvements. In these cases, these models’ generative ability appears too restricted to produce reliable strategies for storage or to interpret retrieved heuristics effectively. The solutions were far too verbose and long. Without sufficiently accurate and efficient base solutions, memory curation cannot yield substantial gains. This limitation ties back to the core premise that effective DC demands a capable foundation model to seed and refine the curated knowledge.

Overall, DC offers a useful and practical framework for continuous, test-time learning in LLMs. Our findings emphasize the synergy between model capacity and memory curation, the importance of structural task similarity and retrieval precision, and the benefits of offloading repeated computations to flexible external stores (e.g., Python scripts). At the same time, alternative mechanisms (e.g., specialized sub-memories or adaptive example ordering) and more sophisticated retrieval techniques (e.g., topological clustering) remain promising directions for further research.

Appendix A Background & Related Work

A.1 Test-time learning (online learning)

Test-time learning—also referred to as online or incremental learning (adaptation)—encompasses a family of methods in which a stochastic model updates its predictions by incorporating information seen during inference, without undergoing conventional, full-scale offline finetuning. Early versions of test-time adaptation focused on local or transductive learning, where a model re-fit or re-weighted its parameters with each new test instance or batch (McCloskey & Cohen, 1989; Thrun & Mitchell, 1995; Amari, 1998; Syed et al., 1999; Bottou & Cun, 2003; Bottou & Le Cun, 2005, inter alia). In computer vision, for example, methods like test-time training have been shown to mitigate domain shifts by optimizing a self-supervised loss on incoming data (Wang et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021; Boudiaf et al., 2022; Niu et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2024). In the context of natural-language generation, test-time adaptation has appeared under terms such as “dynamic evaluation” (Mikolov et al., 2010; Graves, 2013; Krause et al., 2019; Rannen-Triki et al., 2024), in which a language model is updated with gradient steps on the test-time data itself.

However, directly updating language model weights at test time can be computationally expensive and requires the capacity to modify parameters. For large-scale, black-box APIs (e.g., GPT-3 or Claude), one often lacks the ability to perform parameter updates easily, thereby making such an approach difficult, if not completely infeasible (Shi et al., 2024). To address this, a growing body of work has explored parameter-free adaptation, whereby one structurally modifies immediate model inputs (e.g., prompting) or draws from external memory to “update” the model’s effective reasoning. Our approach aligns with this direction by allowing an LM to iteratively record solutions, explanations, or heuristics in an external memory component over successive interactions, avoiding weight updates entirely.

In the broader test-time learning literature, reflexive, compositional, and iterative refinement approaches like Reflexion (Shinn et al., 2023), Self-Refine (Madaan et al., 2023), (Self-)Critic (Gou et al., 2023), Chameleon (Lu et al., 2023), Meta-Prompting (Suzgun & Kalai, 2024), and Self-RAG (Asai et al., 2023) inter alia, use feedback loops or verification mechanisms to correct mistakes in solutions. TextGrad (Yuksekgonul et al., 2025) similarly draws on the notion of “textual gradients” as an alternative to parameter-based gradients and provides a pathway for improvement based on the content of mistakes. Our proposed DC framework differs by focusing explicitly on storing generalizable heuristics, solutions, or meta-level insights that can be repeatedly retrieved and applied across tasks, not just to correct a single solution. Furthermore, DC does not require a new training loop for each batch or scenario; instead, the memory itself is updated to reflect newly found solutions, errors, or strategies without touching the model weights.

A.2 Test-time compute and reasoning

It is now widely known and accepted that contemporary LLMs such as GPT-4 can exhibit substantial improvements in reasoning and generation capability when additional compute is devoted to inference-time strategies (e.g., chain-of-thought prompting (Wei et al., 2022; Kojima et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022), tree-of-thought expansions (Yao et al., 2023; Long, 2023), minimum Bayes risk decoding (Suzgun et al., 2023a; Shi et al., 2022; Golovneva et al., 2023), majority-vote sampling (Wang et al., 2023)). Prompting methods such as Tree-of-Thought (Yao et al., 2023), Graph-of-Thought (Besta et al., 2024), and other non-linear compositional reasoning paradigms systematically enlarge the inference-time search space. They allow models to explore various reasoning paths and exploit consensus or iterative corrections to arrive at more accurate and reliable conclusions (Wei et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023).

However, these expansions come at the cost of increased computational overhead per test instance (Yao et al., 2023). They are, however, typically ephemeral: once a solution is generated, subsequent tasks or input samples do not generally benefit from the heavy compute spent earlier, unless the user manually engineers advanced prompt-sharing or in-context demonstration strategies. Cf. (Zelikman et al., 2022). Our work, on the other hand, aims to reduce repeated overhead across multiple test instances of a similar domain by building a memory that persists from one query to the next. This memory not only reduces repetitive mistakes, but also consolidates and codifies robust solution strategies—effectively amortizing or “sharing” the cost of initial reflection across future tasks.1414
 14

 Some lines of work—such as majority voting or sampling-based self-consistency—combine multiple inference passes for a single question but still lack a persistent knowledge base that spans different queries. DC differs in that we treat consecutive tasks in a sequence as a chance to refine a persistent, external store of learned lessons. The memory curation step selectively compiles relevant solutions, heuristics, expansions, or code blocks into a form that can be reused for upcoming queries. Thus, while the compute for the first few tasks may be higher, future tasks become simpler because the system can consult and adapt previously curated knowledge. This approach echoes the underlying motivation of test-time training—performing ongoing improvement at inference—but capitalizes on a cheap, external memory update in lieu of repeated or expensive parameter updates.

Another related thread involves tool usage or code execution (Schick et al., 2023; Lu et al., 2023; Shen et al., 2023; Qin et al., 2023; Surís et al., 2023; Suzgun & Kalai, 2024). These studies have explored how LLMs can call external Python interpreters, symbolic solvers, or other specialized services and APIs to offload complex computations. Our empirical findings too illustrate that once an LLM under DC recognizes a systematic way (e.g., Python-based brute force algoritgm) to handle a certain class of problems (like arithmetic puzzles), it can store that approach in memory and repeatedly retrieve it. Thus, DC not only invests extra compute in a single session but spreads that computational benefit across multiple interactions, effectively learning to use tools more consistently and reliably over time.

A.3 Memory-augmented generation and reasoning

Augmenting language models with external memory has seen renewed interest in recent years (Munkhdalai et al., 2019; Guu et al., 2020; Khandelwal et al., 2020; Bulatov et al., 2022; Borgeaud et al., 2022; Zhong et al., 2022; Feng et al., 2022; He et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024a)—see also (Graves et al., 2014; Weston et al., 2014; Joulin & Mikolov, 2015; Suzgun et al., 2019) for early studies. Modern retrieval-augmented LLM approaches generally consult an external corpus of documents (i.e., a knowledge base) to improve factuality and reduce hallucination (Lewis et al., 2020; Lazaridou et al., 2023; Vu et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024b), but the retrieval corpus is almost always fixed prior to inference and does not evolve over time. These methods have been especially effective for open-domain question answering (Lewis et al., 2020; Guu et al., 2020; Karpukhin et al., 2020), where the model’s own parameters may not hold all relevant knowledge. In practice, retrieval augmentation typically involves selecting and concatenating top-kk passages from a knowledge-base—while useful for factual queries, the approach, however, does not inherently solve iterative improvement or learning from mistakes in the sense of building upon prior solutions at inference time.

Another line of research more closely aligns with our vision by storing not just reference knowledge but also the reasoning processes and solution strategies of language models. Several recent works have explored this direction. Thought-Retriever (Feng et al., 2024) logs the model’s chain-of-thought from past queries and uses them for new, analogous queries. Buffer-of-Thoughts (Yang et al., 2025, BoT;) takes a slightly different approach by distilling high-level “thought templates” from problem-solving processes, though it relies on predefined templates that seem to be tailored towards specific task types that were considered in their experiments. Madaan et al. (2022) have demonstrated that deployed models like GPT-3 can be improved through memory mechanisms that capture user feedback on errors, preventing similar mistakes in future interactions. Zhang et al. (2024a) have proposed a dual memory architecture combining long-term and short-term storage for medical applications, though their approach requires fine-tuning to incorporate new knowledge.

While these works reveal the many strategies for harnessing memory or feedback, DC emphasizes selectively storing the most relevant insights and heuristics. DC aims to avoid naive accumulation of full raw transcripts and ephemeral chain-of-thought expansions that can lead to memory bloat. Moreover, unlike methods that assume the model can be retrained or finetuned to incorporate memory items, we remain fully external and training-free; this aligns with “plug-and-play” usage principle, in which an off-the-shelf model is augmented by an external memory that it reads from and writes to, but does not require any gradient-based adaptation.

B.2 Clustering of Errors and Corrections

Figure 10: 
t-SNE visualization of the embeddings of the raw questions in GPQA-Diamond. Note that correct and incorrect answers often cluster in latent embedding space. DC can help transfer learned strategies within these clusters, but without careful curation, erroneous heuristics may also spread, thus requiring careful memory refinement and verification of solution strategies.

B.3 Evolution of Memory Content under Dynamic Cheatsheet

Figure 11: 
This figure illustrates how memory content of GPT-4o evolves over time in Game of 24, quantified using a longest-common-subsequence (LCS)-similarity metric (Suzgun et al., 2024) between consecutive states (measured at the word level). While both DC-Cu and DC-RS show high stability after the first few iterations, DC-Cu experiences slightly greater fluctuations in the second half of inference.

B.4 Solution Generator and Memory Curator Prompts

B.4.1 Prompt Used by the Generator Model in Baseline

Figure 12: 
Prompt used in the baseline (BL) approach, where the model receives minimal instructions. The prompt simply asks the model to answer the given question without any structured guidance, additional reasoning steps, or tool-use encouragement. This setup represents a traditional one-off inference method, reflecting how LLMs typically operate by default.

B.4.2 Prompt Used by the Generator Model in DR, FH, and DC Approaches

Figure 13: 
Generator prompt used in the DR, FH, and DC approaches, where the model receives structured high-level instructions on solution development, strategy selection, and tool usage. This prompt explicitly encourages Python code generation and execution for computational tasks. Notably, this same structured prompt is used in all non-BL methods, including DC-∅\emptyset, DR, FH, DC-Cu, and DC-RS. We also remark that during the initial phases of our experiments, we used “cheatsheet” and “memory” interchangeably to describe stored problem-solving content. However, to maintain consistency, we formally define MiM_{i} as memory throughout this paper. Since this was purely a semantic choice, we did not find it necessary to rerun our experiments to reflect this terminology shift.

B.4.3 Prompt Used by the Memory Curation Model under DC-RS

Figure 14: 
Prompt used for the memory curator under DC-RS, which is responsible for maintaining an evolving repository of problem-solving strategies, code snippets, and heuristics. The curator selectively retains high-value insights, refines existing strategies, and organizes memory efficiently. This ensures the memory (cheatsheet) remains concise, generalizable, and action-oriented, continuously improving test-time reasoning. (Once again, we note that during the initial phases of our experiments, we used “cheatsheet” and “memory” interchangeably to describe stored problem-solving content. However, to maintain consistency, we formally define MiM_{i} as memory throughout this paper. Since this was purely a semantic choice, we did not find it necessary to rerun our experiments to reflect this terminology shift.)
